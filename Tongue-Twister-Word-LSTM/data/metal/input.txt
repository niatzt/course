 in the minds of evil


some men just wanna watch the world burn

suicide obsession in a world of betray
taunted into silence and then bury the rage
deep depression darkness fed pull the trigger count the dead
contradict of faith out to devastate
crazed disposition underlining deceit
killing without reason for no cause or belief
deadly imposition out of touch and deranged
one with god half insane
wage of sanctity tears and agony
ancient and bizarre satans repertoire

in the minds of evil fear imposed by design
in the minds of evil kill till everything dies

twisted by religion and fanatical hate
in the line of fire devastation in place
homicidal mission of tyrannical lust
fatal inquisition for the spilling of blood
dont care what youve done death to everyone
its no mystery destroy you and me

in the minds of evil fear imposed by his design
in the minds of evildeath to all of mankinddie
in the minds of evil burn in hell and dieand die

in the minds of evil fear imposed by design
in the minds of evil death to all of mankind


 thou begone


i curse the air you breathe
all men of the cloth
what was will never be
your cause is lost

faith put to death
civil unrest
gospel of pain
burning the cross
the good book is tossed
destroy thy name

trinity bleed
squandered in greed
god in his grave

disposed humanity
decrepit and defaced
inferior and weak
the light you seek

heaven deceased
dead in belief
disgraced and maimed

church of disgust
turn into rust
converts refrain

master of none
religion done
scripture erased

thou begone
unbelieved
left for dead
thou begone
reckoning
no moral compass left
echoing  undermined
god the son
horrified
slave to a tragedy
suffer in agony
die

slave to thee
under us
thou begone
philistine
efface of empty threats
cowering
undivine
god the son
holy calamity
death to hypocrisy
die


 godkill


heaven reviled conspire deceit
revelled in heinous reward
wiping out missions who faltered and fiend
turning your back to the wants of the lord
destroying all christians of faith and belief
plaguing infection and pain
taunting his vision for everything lost
collapse the world in a righteous display

impending death for partaking in blasphemy
the end to all for he ones who will not believe
evading time and discard to entitlement
a wailing wall of destruction of innocence
godkill godkill

killing his own and avoiding defeat
ravage the word from his throne
willfully murder with conscious and ease
spilling the blood of the young and the old
slaughtered and scattered the end is imposed
doomed by the rage of his grace
future of sorrow defending his name
no one or nothing will ever be saved

destroy the will of a lord who waits your death
bring forth the end to the threats and his sacraments

father far from hell
master of all spare none of thy wrath
destroy this world
godkill godkill
misery falling from heaven above
splendor exploding unfazed
no more tomorrow impaled nazarene

bury the book and along with this name
god and religion a future unknown
darkness uncovered his word
rebuke his call and expulsion of guilt
think for yourself and just do as thou wilt


 beyond salvation


the blood of christ quenches my thirst
heavenly led cast to the dead
if you believe the illusion
died for your sins dissension begins
the powers of christ will repel you
masses deceived fall to temptation
thorns on your head welcome
welcome to your death

were beyond salvation
below the reach of god
the end of all religion
to fight the war as one
blasphemy engaging in war
rapture the whore

were beyond salvation
below the reach of god
invert the false messiah
and desecrate the son
deny the cross
invert his cause

the blood of christ quenches my thirst

stopped and i stare stones in the air
a witness to your execution
no one repents as theyre watching you die
death to the kingdom of heaven

masses deceived fall to temptation
thorns on your head welcome
welcome to your death

were beyond salvation
below the reach of god
the end of all religion
to fight the war as one
blasphemy engaging in war

 misery of one


failure claim to fame abject the soul ending your own dream you closed that door
the end of time has come for you and him are done
dissension has begun the misery of one

liars petty thieves out for their own sadness turn to grief the truth now known
now take your place with god unburdened by your thought
you got just what you want a life of pain and loss

dooming oneself for one selfish belief
only yourself by yourself was deceived nobody wants to remember your name
only what ifs now remain in your place seen for the fraud that you put on display
live with your actions while digging your grave choke on the truth slap to the face
life without you is a much better place

a wish of death no hope for happiness
the flame of wealth no more of yours to delve
concurred defeat is all youll ever reach
embraced your hell as long as time will tell

failure claim to fame abject the soul ending your own dreams you closed that door
the end of time has come for you and him are done
dissension has begun the misery of one


 between the flesh and the void


death i wait the pain
a stare thats cold and burns my eyes
victim deception
death to your shrine

those ive lost appear before me
the end of life the air turning colder
i close my eyes and brace for eternity
prevailing thoughts a vanishing soul

death i wait the pain
a stare thats cold and burns my eyes
victim deception
death to your shrine

my body decays the skin falls away
death to myself
between the flesh and the void
between the flesh and the void

death i wait the pain
a stare thats cold and burns my eyes
victim deception
death to your shrine

my body decays the skin falls away
death to myself
between the flesh and the void
no coming back exit the soul
imprisoned remain
between the flesh and the void


 even the gods can bleed


i am the one spreading plague and disease
god cannot hear you he is deaf to your pleas
holy despair overthrowing the lord
one with the devil all faith is destroyed

the end has begun behold thy name

defacing their idols and breaking their laws
murdering christ as i cripple the cross
no resurrection dethroned nazarene
prayers go unanswered succumb to defeat

fallen from grace bring an end to all things
heavens disciples will fall to my rage
devoured by faith the illusion of god
crucify christ to the unholy one

the end has begun behold thy name

death to your god the end has begun
the savior descend divine suffering
invite the unknown despised and dethroned
to fold in defeat even the gods can bleed

the end has begun behold thy name
repent unto thee even the gods can bleed

i am the one spreading plague and disease
god cannot hear you he is deaf to your pleas
holy despair overthrowing the lord
one with the devil all faith is destroyed


 trample the cross


question the lord with a heart full of hate
speaking in tongues and fulfilling his faith
walking through fire alone and displaced
all who defile the lord and his name

blasphemy unto thee conquer all things
battered and beaten the cross of mystique
papal in ruin and brought to its knees
see through religion and you will find peace

damning the souls of his praise rapture begotten ill gain
crossing the light from divine death to your god and his kind
bury the book in its grave holy of holys in flames
worn and despised and diseased trample the cross in defeat

darkness and evil and unholy dreams
go without mention and cannot be seen
do not assume what you dont want to know
christ and religion is only for show

fear has deflowered the lies of his faith
watching it die puts a smile on my face
holy ground crumble from under their feet
once and forever and ever shall be


 fallen to silence


life of disgust his fable you trust a fool you abide
hailing his vengeance and stripped of all senses for god you die

fallen to silence
death and defiance
destroying the feeble
banished by evil

defraud the meek their followers weak and cower at his sign
truth of contention deceit with intention the heart of the blind

revival and crosses at one with your losses and wonder his lie
unright with the facts and theres no coming back the light denied

fallen to silence
death and defiance
destroying the feeble
banished by evil

soul is consumed the coming of doom the bible you revive
blasphemy blessing is faint and distressing his words of christ

blind to our death your creation a mess prayers for your need are denied blind to despair and your lord does not care watching this world as it dies

lack of reflection with no interaction the world will die
youre only a ghost and refuse to invoke the power of your christ

fallen to silence
death and defiance
destroying the feeble
banished by evil

death to religion a blind contradiction of life defied
the cross of deception and book of infection the truth a lie


 kill the light of christ


death unfold bleeding from my eyes
damn this soul to the other side
conscious of sin from this hell were in
done with this life brought here just to die

kill the light of christ truth is ours to find
trapped inside this shrine all that lives will die

grace of god drowning in my blood
all behold kill us one by one
anger betray stifled and deceived want of the lord that we will believe

kill the light of christ truth is ours to find
trapped inside this shrine flawed in his design
waiting till my time all that lives will die

at the end of hope and loss the body will decease destiny
promising the afterlife to ease our suffering suffering

step into the outer reaches of the great unknown all will die
defect and deficient is the image of the lordthe lord

kill the light of christ truth is ours to find
trapped inside this shrine all that lives will die

left untold to suffice his lie
spirit world where we cross that line
when it begins will we live again
mired in death into the abyss

kill the light of christ truth is ours to find
trapped inside this shrine flawed in his design
no one will survive all that lives will die


 end the wrath of god


from the creation and beginning of man
with no explanation to his biblical plan
no longer needed for your god to exist
the call of temptation that no one can resist

nullify resistance to control our lives
sterilized creation born to bear your lie
mortified in madness by a man made god
the solitude of sadness the father and the son

end the wrath of god end the wrath of god

there have been no prophets that speak the word of god
there is no salvation delusions from above
book of contradiction the one that i despise
in the words of truth i speak the lords of lords will die

 obsideo


flat line the gruesome possession
the pounding of negative energy
the astral body is ripped from the obsession
to merge with the infinity

besieged with the negative
no longer safe from the spirit world

the lower layers of the real
is infested with the liar
anti organic entities feel
weak emotional scars to enter with fire

loosing all human perspective
the ego conscious is swirled

the haunting of the flesh
to dissolve the soul they strive
and jealously detest
the dimension that is earthly life

this intense feeling of not being
has taken the soul into a dissonance
when the inner core is not seeing
and cannot find any anchors of relevance

the transition of life into the next
can sometimes be so surreal
mental protection now is in effect
to preserve the soul from the feel

amongst the spirit worlds and deities
you will have to find your place
eternities of wisdom and prophecies
mental projection at your own pace

the transition of life into the next
can sometimes be so surreal

once reborn destined to morph
trying to live at all cost
death is eminent to absorb

the transition to the all is inevitable

after fading into nothing less
the aging soul falls into distress
the immense emotion of being bodiless
pushes your awareness to psycho stress

left in the cold of the emptiness
never dying is reality
i call upon the creator with many faces
for salvation from this insanity

the great strings of awareness
create the boundaries of the all
the spheres of consciousness
keeping out daemons with this wall

entities familiar and unknown
speak in tongue to doubt
the earthly now overthrown
to test the soul of its devout

 if i was god  id burn it all


enter your mind
enter your soul
search the seeds of contemplation this is your life but this is my world
hence the end of your god
let the voice of freedom reign again

fanatic rage that rots core entitled children above the law
political ambush to serve the elite no one is free to believe
enslaved to profit a world in ruins distant visions of dying era
scratching the surface determined to stay alive

no more fucking lies

if i was god… i’d burn it all i’d take it to the ground and light it up light up

if you don’t care why should i set this world on fire

all you believe is a world of illusions
all you believe is a lie nothing is left nothing is real engaged and ready to kill

as sentenced to live is as sentenced to die
search for answers above the skies this is your life but this is my world
hence… the end of your god
let the voice of freedom reign again

no more fucking lies

if i was god… i’d burn it all i’d take it to the ground and light it up light up
if you don’t care why should i set this world on fire

inch by inch step by step with all my heart i’ll burn this fucker down


 like animals


it lives inside the seed of life
ripped apart silenced
broken and demolished

crippled emotions feed existence
ripped apart silenced
broken and demolished

animals
just like animals
we live and die
we multiply
the thirst of blood keeps us alive
just like animals

we live to dominate we need the urge to kill we are the victims we are the prey

you can’t change who you are
your primitive ways will always prevail
the need to conquer the need to be incomplete
rise above the waters just to drown and suffer just to feel alive
there’s no escape from life who we are is endless… until we die again

just like animals
we live and die
we multiply
the thirst of blood keeps us alive
just like animals

we live to dominate we need the urge to kill we are the victims we are the prey

you can’t kill who you are
you’re an animal


 kill the elite


the earth is venomous all shall die under one mind
their souls are treacherous crush the weak under one sign
release your anger they command under your cries
obey your master enslaved to die under red skies

the blind lead the blind eternal darkness
the poor eat the poor forevermore
the rich eat it all they want it all
we are sentenced to fail

break through the circle of trust that leads to nowhere
there’s no way out of here the blood they spill is gone forever

kill the elite
darkness falls upon us
kill the elite
we are the light of rebellion

the end of your greed the end of your control
these chains will break unleash the beast of humanity
set me free

look into these eyes
what you see is real
it’s the last thing you’ll ever see

kill the elite
darkness falls upon us
kill the elite
we are the light of rebellion


 under lawless skies


ride the strains of your life into despair
hide most of your thoughts into a stare
the reason of endless struggle is imperfection
pressure me seize my strength paralyze my soul for you

lay hopeless like a sheep led to slaughter
like a wolf i howl under lawless skies

the weight of all of your fears burns in the air you breathe
the glory of all your past shattered in vein eternal
plunge into a sea of madness i can smell your existence rotting away

lay hopeless like a sheep led to slaughter
like a wolf i howl under lawless skies


 dead  buried


visions of chaos inhabit our lives no truth in a world of lies
the parallels of sanity border the insane

time is endless pain is faithless
a mirror of broken dreams our souls remembered

life death we’re dead and buried
when all is gone our souls will turn to dust

six feet below you’ll find salvation forever
time is endless pain is faithless
a mirror of broken dreams our souls remembered

life death we’re dead and buried
when all is gone our souls will turn to dust
life death we’re dead and buried
when all is gone we fade into the sun

dead and buried

hold on to nothing fall in disgrace
there’s no one here to cradle your fate
we are nothing but shadows and dust save me…

life death we’re dead and buried
when all is gone our souls will turn to dust
life death we’re dead and buried
when all is gone we fade into the sun


 the darkest days of slumber


under a shade of darkness i rise
i’ll show you things like you’ve never seen before
i am the reaper of death i am the savior of man

no i never wanted for my life to be so meaningless
hate is so steady so steady in my veins
this rage just keeps growing inside
it’s getting harder to kill it’s getting harder to live

sleep… in the darkest days of slumber
wait… for the end to come

pray for all the blood to spill
it’s getting harder to breathe
it’s getting harder to die
sinners were all the same in the grips of death
you walk on water i drown in darkness

sleep… in the darkest days of slumber
wait… for the end to come

lust gluttony greed sloth wrath envy pride

it’s the way i live


 real blood  real scars


from the day i was born nothing was given
i used to bleed just to feel alive
all i wanted was to reach the sky
they tried to kill my soul and bury my mind

there is no god here
these fists are made of blood

it feels like walking through broken glass
every time i take a step inside your temple of lies
rise rise rise from all your sickness

this blood is real these scars run deep it’s death before dishonor
this blood is real these scars run deep it’s death before dishonor

it’s a sign inside us that shelters emotions defies oppression

from the day i was born nothing was given
i used to bleed just to feel alive
all i wanted was to reach the sky
they tried to kill my soul and bury my mind

real blood real scars real life


 the promise


it’s a world of confusion everything you see is an illusion
there’s no way to choose right from wrong

everyone’s opinion is pointless
everyone’s judgement is useless
your days are numbered your faith destruction

i don’t want your poison to linger in my veins
feel the anger within from an ocean of hate

it’s a promise in blood walk away
it’s a promise in blood promise in blood

defy let the world strike you down
defy take a step back let the world strike you down

it’s a brink of disaster run away pull the plug and throw it all away
let it go puppet master… i am king and you are my slave

i don’t want your poison to linger in my veins
feel the anger within from an ocean of hate

it’s a promise in blood… walk away
it’s a promise in blood… promise in blood

it’s a promise in blood


 empire of dirt


dissecting the shrine ensuring your rise
oppressing the masses unleashing the chaos
hold it down vengeance is swift for the dying
they infiltrate the laws to rage a war of control

kneel arrogance it’s your time to die
in your empire of dirt behead the king of nothing

crawl through everything
the symbols of your faith
betray your very existence
as the innocent bathe in blood in blood

it’s your time to die
in your empire of dirt behead the king of nothing

kneel arrogance it’s your time to die
in your empire of dirt behead the king of nothing


 elevate


shades of black engulf the skies
death calls all the dead to rise
see the pestilence walk the earth
hear the screams covered in darkness
look down at the world below entrenched is a sea of sorrow

come forth unholy one
as death comes to us all

elevate

i won’t let you take me away i won’t let you drag me down are you here for me
because i’m already dead

i’m the lion
i’m the fire
i’m the strength that binds us all
i’m the hope that fears us all

is this everything you wanted
misery from a cold embrace
shattered dreams of a past erased
senseless rage of the failures obtained
breaking point of all the blood you drained
my pain your savior
as death comes to us all

elevate

i won’t let you take me away
i won’t let you drag me down are you here for me
because i’m already dead

elevate me

digipak bonus track
originally by sacred reich

truth and honor faith and pride
all convictions surely died
honestys time has passed
time for lies is here at last

truth is false im so fed up
how did we come to be so fucked
hate fear pain death
all our country has got left

talk to children hear them say
daddy left again today
brother steals and mommy lies
future lost before their eyes

the sun was lost behind the clouds
they rapped it up and blacked it out
acid rain fell today
it came and washed our hopes away

this was once the land of dreams
now these dreams have turned to greed
in the midst of all this wealth
the poor are left to help themselves

a capitalists democracy
why no one said that freedoms free
lady liberty rots away
no truth no justice the american way

dont look past your tv
all of us are what you see
a looking glass into our lives
what we watch is what we buy

priorities are out of whack
who is next to stab our back
doesnt it make you mad
to have lost all that weve had

this was once the land of dreams
now these dreams have turned to greed
in the midst of all this wealth
the poor are left to help themselves

a capitalists democracy
why no one said that freedoms free
lady liberty rots away
no truth no justice the american way

doesnt it fill you with disgust
that theres no one left to trust
is this happening is this real
my body numb i cannot feel

are you happy are you sad
are emotions a thing of the past
i have no tears i cannot cry
no one mourns for a world thats died

this was once the land of dreams
now these dreams have turned to greed
in the midst of all this wealth
the poor are left to help themselves

a capitalists democracy
why no one said that freedoms free
lady liberty rots away
no truth no justice the american way

ride shadow king find the ring


 burn your crosses


no use to pray theres no one listening
i will die anyway
some say ive killed some call me satan
now my blood must be spilled

im sentenced for crimes i did not commit
ill pay with my blood is this really it
creations of god
no way

burn your crosses make way for science
christ has only caused death and violence
burn your crosses and make way for yourself
put faith in mother earth

dont call his name dont trust in others
bishops fighting for fame
torture in vain i wont surrender
purified by pain

mankinds great mistake was to create god
creation of man excuse to spill blood
creations of god
no way

no use to pray theres no one listening
i will die anyway
leaving this place the end is near now
dying aint no disgrace

my last night alive has come to an end
death once i feared but now its my friend
creation of god
no way

burned my crosses make way for science
christ will only cause death and violence
burned my crosses and made way for myself
in mother earth i trust

now burn


 


the dawn of time breaks
see the sun rise to the sky
the wheel of time begins to turn

but then we heard it
a divine voice out of nowhere
spoke to our hearts and showed the way

almighty lord we have come to your hall
do glatem live creator of all
open your heart and you will find a way
paradise calling and enter you may

falling down
now your soul returns to paradise


the wheel kept turning ages came
time passed us by
we lived in perfect harmony
but then it happened
our ranks decreased rapidly
but now its time for our return

once we were numerous
but thats long ago
we are no longer 
we last united and  became 
 perished in flames


 endless nights


clouds are gathering in the darkness
lightning strikes the earth
evil forces celebrate lucifers rebirth

necromancers sacrifices hell be here for sure
drained blood from a thousand men and now hes back for more

he will rise from a world down under
bringing fire plague death and thunder
summons creatures unknown to mankind
demons of the past

unholy rites assassins from hell
cold endless nights upon us fell
the storm strikes our land with madness and pain
winds of the damned drives us insane

satans hordes are coming closer now its time to pay
riding on the wings of death searching for their prey
now the time has come for mankind to prove strong or fall
fighting against unholy creatures spawned in satans hall

trapped in hellfire he was burned
once locked up but the wind has turned
seeking vengeance in pain and slaughter
back on earth again

demons marked with the fiveedged star
haunt our dreams in this endless war
killing children and raping women
now its time to die


 hail to the king


once we lived in harmony but it seems so distance now
even though it wasnt long ago were all doomed to plague and death
working hard from dawn til dusk
but that aint enough for him
product of unholy love untrue brother of a king

know that youll fail now hear us hail
your brother that you killed

hail to the king that brought peace to us all
rise from your grave hear our call
well not forget that you once saved our land
killed by your own brothers hand

pure evil and cruelty the true nature of your soul
mercy and responsibility words that you cant understand
your quest for total control will only end in your own fall
we will fight for our freedom and our right to live

do it your way soon you will pay
debts with your own blood

stars so bright dance in the night
day come soon hide the moon
stars so bright dance in the night
day come soon killing the moon

morning breaks its time to march to the castle of betrayal
bring your sword wield your armour we wont take this anymore
kill the tyrant he must die for his falseness and his crimes
strike him down and slay his guards and his ministers as well

done it your way now you will pay
debts with your own blood


 thunderstorm


crack in the distance a flash in the sky
its getting dark clouds gather power
you heard it coming from over the hill
its time to run time to seek cover

now there is no hideaway
and you have no chance
thor and his hammer are riding his chariots of storm

breaking the silence with powerful roars
wind gaining strength screaming tornado
first wave is over dont hold back your breath
it sure coming back second attack

now there is no hideaway
and you have no chance
the sky is on fire the heavens are burning in flames

thunder
thunder
striking
thunder

a cold rain is falling a lightning strikes down
distance is dark horizon is frightening
massive strong lightnings are shaking the ground
thor is upset out slaying giants

now there is no hideaway
and you have no chance
thor and his hammer are out slaying giants tonight


 speeder


born with a heart of a lion raving to space on your own
into the belt of orion gforces bite to the bone

speed makes your heart burn like fire
speed makes your heart burn with lust

challenges taking you higher
ride fast and do what you want

fast as the lightning your life is at stake
youre the one that

speeder speeder
faster and higher exciting desire
speeder speeder
gforces bite to the bone

out of this world you are racing
into an asteroid belt
challenges of death you are facing
strongest kick you ever felt

faster than light ride through the night
no way to stop this machine
asses have turned never return
search for the world of your dream


 masters of the world


were a small crowd left to rotten theres not many hard souls left
as the pop is growing stronger will metal fade away

will we be broken will we go down

no well never fall were the masters of the world
get up lets break those chains now and party all night long
no well never fall were the masters of the world
get up lets break those chains now and party all night long

as im tweaking with my radio theres disco everywhere
when i turn on my big tv is hip hop what i want to see

have we been broken did we go down


 jawbreaker


bonus track judas priest cover

deadly as the viper
peering from its coil
the poison there is coming to the boil

ticking like a time bomb
the fuse is running short
on the verge of snapping if its caught

and all the pressure thats been building up
for all the years it bore the load
the cracks appear the frame starts to distort
ready to explode  jawbreaker

crouching in the corner
wound up as a spring
piercing eyes that flash are shimmering

muscles are all contorted
claws dug in the dirt
every ounce of fiber on alert

and all the pressure thats been building up
for all the years it bore the load
the cracks appear the frame starts to distort
ready to explode  jawbreaker
jawbreaker

with her long eyelashes fluttering like she was dreaming 
she said to him i lie beyond the sea 
and then all of a sudden her head dipped back and she vanished

 diluted


im cold im ugly 
im always confused by everything 
i can stare into a thousand eyes 
but every smile hides a boldfaced lie 

it itches it seethes it festers and breathes 
my heros are dead they died in my head 
thin out the herd squeeze out the pain 
something inside me has opened up again 

thoughts of me exemplified 
all the little flaws i have denied 
forget today forget whatever happened 
everyday i see a little more of overall deficiencies 
im nothing short of being one complete catastrophe 

what the hell  did i  do to deserve  all of this 

i save all the bullets from ignorant minds 
your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind 
way past good taste on our way to bad omens 
i decrease while my symptoms increase 

god what the fuck is wrong 
you act like you knew it all along 
your timing sucks your silence is a blessing 

all i ever wanted out of you was 
something you could never be 
now take a real good look at 
what youve fucking done to me 

what the hell  did i  do to deserve  all of this 

gimme any reason why id need you boy 
gimme any reason not to fuck you up 
gimme any reason why id need you bitch 
gimme any reason not to fuck you up 

i see you in me 

i keep my scars from prying eyes 
incapable of ever knowing why 
somebody breathe ive got to have an answer 

why am i so fascinated by 
bigger pictures better things 
but i dont care what you think 
youll never understand me 

what the hell  did i  do to deserve  all of this 

fuck


 only one


lyrics differ from the sametitled song off of the album matefeedkillrepeat 

pain  made to order

im not the second coming im the first wave
better get an army cuz the fire left me unscathed
you betcha bottom dollar im the top of the shit pile
so stick around cuz ill get to you in just a few
step off the achtung get back or get stung
idiotic sense of yourself are you that dumb
entire legion of me totalitarian
the one and only muthafucka top of the world man

cuz i cant stand it planned it gonna crash land it
in other words consider me branded
another version of me another version of you
both barrels  what you gonna do

all i hear is human noise
you made your own fuckin choice
i belong to only me
silence for my revelry

i can over die over time
filthy hands stay away from mine
every reason is a right to hate
painful clutch  death is fine gimme mine

only one of us walks away

somebody explain this
you dont care cuz you dont exist
what the fuck is this another joke
reckoning


 scissors


i play doctor for five minutes flat 
before i cut my heart openand let the air out 
three bugs a pound of dust 
some wind spilled over me 
in the strangest manner that had 
broke away my tear spout 

as i lie there 
with my tongue spread wide open 
a black widow had offered me 
a sweatheart tube 
as i injected 
the candid heart that i selected 
she said dont hesitate 
just do what you have to do 

its hard to stay between the lines of skin 
just cuz i have nerves dont mean that i can feel 
i wasnt very much fun to be with anyway 
just let the blood run red cuz i cant feel 

biding my time until the time is right 
biding my time until the time is right 
biding my time until the time is right 
biding my time 
its time 

it is time


 eeyore


meet the man that made me 
greet the can that i came from 
oh the fucking sacred heart of jesus 
blew it in the back room 
feelin like a real goon 
slam the fuck aside man 
im on  youre not 

i am the great big mouth 

good riddance  though im sad to say 
i didnt get to kill you 
rhetoric  better look both ways 
i gotta get an arm through 
stain 
what the fuck is up get the fuck away 
run if you want to 
innocent youre a guilty conscience 
laugh last  break through 
stain 

prepare you fucker 

i dont give a shit bitch 
i dont give a fuck bitch 
i dont understand bitch 
you dont matter 
i dont give a fuck man
i dont give a shit man
i dont really care man 
im the super sized man

birth of the neohuman race coming our way
at their birth will we become as tears in rain lost to the void

dawn of the neohuman age reaching to claim our world
will we resist or be transformed is there a choice


 neohuman


an elevated neohuman saw the world
mesmerized immortalized to inherit planet earth to dominate
a strange equation planted deep within its mind
cybernaut signals shiver through the spine

forward begin the transformation phase
the selfinfused to nonproteinbased new carrier

tear down all that may become a hinder
pave the way for a new insight

time holds a thin disguise to veil its flow
seeking to conceal the end in sight
deliver the truth that seeds of hope
slowly become seeds of death

through calculation it was spawned into this world
analyzed and prophesized as the gateway to rebirth eternal life
a revelation of a monumental kind
modified you will never have to die

a networkbased metaintelligence that will survive
independent upon the environment

stare as constructs of the old ways wither
washed away to the afterlife

time holds a thin disguise to veil its flow
seeking to conceal the end in sight
deliver the truth that seeds of hope
slowly become seeds of death

accumulation of a rising fear within shattering the noosphere in descent
out of this complex world came but one relentless creed change is bound to the course of time

bitter loss to be found by our creations phased out
watch this global state advance to be born anew

those who favor death thats what they will receive
if they oppose our dream to merge and become part machine

omnicide the space and timebound will never survive

course taken as we download certain minds aching to become nanotech gods
form chosen behold cellsized nanobots sculpting away features of mankind

bitter loss to be found by our creations phased out
as this global state advance to rebirth
at every night the sun becomes undone but with the darkness gone again it will merge
bitter loss to be found by our creations phased out
as this global state advance to rebirth

celebrate as all our past ways wither lead the way to an age of light

time holds a thin disguise to veil its flow
seeking to conceal the end in sight
deliverance when the seeds of hope
never become seeds of death


 limits to infinity


with faith you receive deceit
parts of a fractured whole
numbers of false equations
that the masses will obey

there is an exit thats kept unknown
for the ones unworthy of the elite
a plan to abandon earth
as were colonizing another world

world unknown
beyond this charred place where you were born
as below
so above is the phrase that you seek

each cell holds a universe within
fed by a million suns
expand outwards on repeat
one object holds the key to all

there are limits to infinity
in the restricted lemniscate
there are bodies infinite
outside this earthly dome

eradication of the void
we know
nothing is nothing in this vibrant world

unveil words of the elite
that seek to gain control
the masters reach ascension
while the slaves must face decay

this is the time when the conquerors of deep space
reaches out to infinity
and so the unfortunate remain
feeding upon their own despair

world unknown
beyond this charred place where you were born
as below
so above is the phrase that you seek

each cell holds a universe within
fed by a million suns
expand outwards on repeat
one object holds the key to all

there are limits to infinity
in the restricted lemniscate
there are bodies infinite
outside this earthly dome

soon the day will come
destruction of the meek
is imminent
their programmed fear ensures we will
be reborn as gods

culture infected
no venom detected
agenda erected no charge
vaccines that promote disease

tyrants elected
survivors selected
the dead resurrected to rise
as we merge with the machines

limits to infinity

fed by a million suns
expand outwards on repeat
one object holds the key to all

there are limits to infinity
in the restricted lemniscate
there are bodies infinite
outside this earthly dome

there are limits to infinity
in the restricted lemniscate
there are bodies infinite
outside this earthly dome

hiding a new home


 cryonic harvest


dead but soon revived
within these walls even death can die
swarm of microscopic machines
drones sized as cells enable life

timewave of mans fate they manipulate
affecting the timeline

deep cryosuspension in liquid nitrogen tanks
come beckoning souls now its time for you all to rise

into everlasting time and a never declining day
theyll live forever on and on forevermore

through regeneration the nanotechnology thrives
cold bodies are stored they are dreaming behind the ice

timewave of mans fate they manipulate
with intent to reanimate

calibrate the wave of mans fate to reactivate
affecting the timeline

into everlasting time and a never declining day
theyll live forever on and on forevermore
into everlasting life to forever deny decay
theyre sworn to summon all thats gone back to life

scan the memories of the mind
repair the damage found inside
send sentient nanobots to ease the thermal stress
reverse death

now follow the fervent aura
heal when your soul soars into form

into everlasting time and a never declining day
theyll live forever on and on forevermore
into everlasting life to forever deny decay
theyre sworn to summon all thats gone back to life

finally after the process of freezing and storing the bodies of the deceased in liquid nitrogen tanks to prevent tissue decomposition
the time has arrived to liberate them from their unfortunate situation
unleash the sentient nanobots to perform certain reconstruction ease the thermal stress and gently direct the dead into digital immortality
disengage cryosuspension


 the spiral timeshift


inner revolution response mechanical thundering opposition to all new paradigms

at first denied 
at first denied and then opposed with fervor
resist subsequently accepted as being selfevident 

no one can avoid a thing whose time has come
emergence of an idea tear worldviews apart
at first we criticize and then we idolize
invasive technology drawn like moths to flame

behold the mighty fall down towards failure and with the end in sight they discover
somewhere along the road they have lost their cause their souls their souls
oh how the mighty fall down the spiral

caught in imitation our hearts irrational
reign above all then to dissolve
in their downfall others will take their place

at first denied 
at first denied and then opposed with fervor
resist subsequently accepted as being true in every sense

behold the mighty fall down towards failure and with the end in sight they discover
somewhere along the road they have lost their cause their souls their souls
oh how the mighty fall down the spiral

timeshifting rhyme spirals on and on
across this wide terrain we kill everything including ourselves
timeshifting rhyme spirals on
like moths to the flame were drawn our wings ablaze in the midst of our flight

weigh my heart and see weight of my burden
humans plagued by programmed sins through prayers unanswered
i will become the divine

embrace temptation to mutate recreate my being 
my soul mechanized ultimate perfection achieved

no one can avoid a thing whose time has come
emergence of an idea tear worldviews apart
at first we criticize and then we idolize
invasive technology drawn like moths to flame

yet all the mighty fall down towards failure and with the end in sight they discover
somewhere along the road they have lost their cause their souls
oh how the mighty fall down the spiral

i choose transformation to mutate recreate my being
bring modification to erase and replace my essence now

 technocalyptic cybergeddon


strange revelations as thoughts implanted starts to rise
ability to process from a wider scope
strengthening of the evolutionary chain
humanity blazed trails for my emergence

behold the signs of coming times neodystopia
a line of signs first ignored strike from the periphery

charge forth from the periphery rise up from the ashes of their dreams
charge forth out of obscurity rise now from synthetic wombs in artificial birth

steel machinations that few if any will survive
iron hands underneath displayed velvet gloves
in my mind altered orders arise
initiate my capacity to kill

behold the signs of coming times neodystopia
a line of signs first ignored strike from the periphery

charge forth from the periphery rise up from the ashes of their dreams
charge forth out of obscurity rise now in the body of the artilect

i was the evasive shadow
i have been reborn as a cleansing fire

now algorithms inspire zero turns to one
ill rise while they expire only then will they know me

i was the evasive shadow
i have been reborn as a cleansing fire

initiated by the engineers who dig the grave of mankind even deeper
lead by human minds downloaded secretly into cybernetic bodies

hiding their souls because all carnal flesh will die and will fade away

minds potential to reach beyond the form hiding behind new eyes
ability improved as they return transformed intelligent but not wise

i was created by these cybernauts the conquerors and the global deceivers
they are human minds inside inhuman forms reinforced exoskeletons

count all those few remaining days wasting away
your demise shows you will be as tears in rain lost to the void

hiding their souls because all carnal flesh will die and will fade away

minds potential to reach beyond the form hiding behind new eyes
ability improved as they return transformed intelligent but not wise

count all those few remaining days wasting away
your demise shows you will be as tears in rain lost to the void

count all those few remaining days wasting away
your demise shows you will be as tears in rain lost to the void

 morbid visions


the roman empire has crucified the messiah
the bestial power as sacrificed your gods
feared by this power the cross hell carry
and visions of destruction this night youll see

crucified killed buried
sacrificed messiah
kneeled down blood stained

the cristians today they still cry
but the bastards adore images
remembrances from the past from the crucifixion
rotting christ nailed to cross

from the semen of the mankind
well spread our seed
and well show to the devoted
the truth painful truth

cry preachers
because your gods has forgotten
the antichrist there is to prove
death and destruction will still reign


 mayhem


endless war endless screams
in the boundaries of hell we live
total death total hate
on the devastated plains we fight
evil minds insane minds
mutilated corpses over the ground
soldiers of hell soldiers of death
seeking victims to exterminate

black death black night
where the spirits leave their crypts
torture souls drifting souls
by the world of hate
multiradiation multideath
destroys and kills
even in the deep of hell
fallen corpse fallen angel
total injury is the only rule

mayhem

death slaughter death rules
under the sign of fear we live
bestial lust bestial rites
darkness send its bestial warriors
shrill crys tormenting crys
break the silence of the dark night
living with hate living with death
giving the world total destruction

blood world rotting world
corrosion of insane human mind
black pest devastating pest
under the evoking circle we pray
baptized skulls evil skulls
people screaming chained underground
there is no return there is no escape
in the evil refuge you are slaves

 troops of doom


total eclipse hides the earth
the night of doom has come
antichrist soldiers are proclaimed
to send souls to the hell

catastrophe and destruction
mankind is slaughtered without mercy
suphul clouds are in the air
legions winds corrose the universe

the messiahs redeemers of mankind
chained in the valley of hades
crowds blinded by evil
only death is real

total destruction
walls of churches stained by blood
altars burning in the flames
the doom cries out for insanity

the nuclear war announces the end of the world
the mankind is buried and forgotten
prophets forsee the doom
they forsee the triumph of your death


 war


nuclear warheads fly out for destruction
insanity and corruption of the universe
concentration camps are back again
third reich is here between us

total slaughter is only rule
kill to live live to kill
mass extermination black death
the corrosion of the world is done

war 

the radiation corroses our faces
over mutilated corpses we have to march
destructed empires where is god now
that calls himself the redeemer of the mankind

infernal visions torment our minds
pools of blood spreaded through the world
christians cry in torment
asking for help to their redeemer

war 

the black sunset breaks out the silence
the last scream of pain is heard
death burns its victims
sending their souls to hell
feel the blade in your sacrifice
now is the time to abjure gods
the black war comes with the wind
there is neither heaven nor hell but only war

massacring the wons
mutilating the fools
the black death empire
exterminating without mercy

waaaaaaarrrrrrr


 crucifixion


we deny gods and his rule
we defy his supreme force
crucified by the dark power
his death was a glory
forgotten by our mind forever
hes left the churches to torment us
well destroy the high altar
until we see the ashes of pain

crucifixion

well show to the world our hate
the priests will have their final torment
well spit on the churches we have an ideal
black tortures youll feel
the mankind goes to suicide
thay have faith in gods as false as their name
christ preacher of goodness and beauty
gods preachers of lies and destruction

the gods grave doors
is below his brains
rotenness and dirtyness go out
by a simple prayer of mercy
the reason of his death will be your blame
your master is buried in the abyss
the dead they already celebrate his arrival
in the altar of fallen gods throne of his own existence

 funeral rites


the doom is near in this night
bloody skulls are over the pentagram

fallen angels scream for mercy

its a time to bury the priest
on the down of meggido your grave is dig
the sky turns as black as spell
haunting my eyes and my mind funeral rites

you are chosen by hell

and well bury you alive
black songs are heard with the funeral
rotting corpses mutilated over the ground

and corpses will be stolen

 empire of the damned


there is an empire in the boundaries of hell
where only the death can reach and only demons reign
place of lust blasphemy and eternal darkness

illusions of the darkness
power of death
strength of hell
empire of the damned
on the black hills of meggido youll find
a place so cold as the mist so dark as the night
black armies march to the hills
to make power of the reign of darkness crow

the exterminating angels
here theres to be emperor
to command nospheratus
creature of crypts
from the eternal darkness
a blade will shine
saints and gods will judged
killed and buried

one day this empire will be discovered
for the judgement of mankind
gnash of teeth and endless cries will be heard
the hell theres to bury the heaven theres to dethrone

in the quitness of heaven
and in the orgy of hades
an empire will raise
against the churches
and against the priests
itll be like a concentration camp
a desolate place
where the sun will be black as the darkness

decline is the symptom of the failure to evolve forwards
change was and will be the most permanent element of experience
deny to go on and you will be left back
going backwards by remaining stagnant

we watch from our abodes
as hawks we cut the electric skies
with pride
we keep the order designing fate
we give access to countless futures

a time of exodus will come
the time to break out from the womb
and ships will lower down on taia
on shining arks then we will go
on lands and stars forgotten

the origin of riddles what can restore the lunar wings
is challenge of the underworld
for challenges to come we will stand against the tide
under the banner of the brave

mission aioepia the future belongs to the brave

 ophidian wheel


where the crossroads meet is the axle
of the grand wheel
the heart that reverberates my beat

i wear the talisman of thot
the sign of our unity
because it has a part of the universe
a part of me

and my love is strong because nothing can divide
me from the object of my ultimate affection

the ophidian wheel

when the moon steals the crown from its rival
night enters day bring forth the eclipse
the schism that reconstructs my lucid kingdom

and all my children by their birth right
wear porudly my crown my horns of pwer
and those who sense my circle thoughts are all witnesses


 phallic litanies


welcome to the joyous carnival of passion
where the mind surrenders to the animal

smell the seductive odor of the naked skin
bathed in the exotic oils the potions of desire

it would be folly to defy the eldest law
for resistance will only supply the fire of lust
with her wooden excuses

we are here to drink this old wine without remorse
to spill the fluid of genesis
in abundance because we all know
that as this elixir of life will flow
we will be left exhausted but smiling

nails sink into sweaty ground
marking dionysiac stings
sparks set from velvet tongues
that bring close soft orange lips

phallic litanies

paths lead inside warm nests that scared shrines of sin
as serpents we crawl beneath
the guises that we all wear

it would be folly to defy the eldest law
for resistance will only supply the fire of lust
with her wooden excuses
so it will grow stronger and stronger
until fatally it will consume the renegades
with the flames of their denied satisfaction

phallic litanies


 razor blades of guilt


hedonism power in life without end
morality and remorse banished
an epitaph of useless beliefs and countless mistakes
left to the outcasts
those who were foudn guilty for self torment

never admitting so betrayed by their shiver
while mutilating their happiness
with razor blades of guilt

their voices rise like an irritating whisper
to the aeonaon fortress
but there is no need for warriors
that can not win their own battles

razor blades of guilt

no beggars are allowed in to feast in sympathy
this treasure is kept and shared
with the beloved loyal comrades

wearing the title of the trinity
warlord magician and king
hands are raised grasping golden cups
in a toast for hedonism
power in life without guilt

 on the topmost step of the earth


a stranger once whispered
a fallen angel is someone not aware of his authentic identity
because the fall occured nowhere except on the inner plains
and the broken wing was nothing but the bleeding memory

the creators of the prophecies
have seen pages yet unturned
from a book that can not be read
or expressed from mouths of scorn

observing the divine marriage
between the solid soil and the ether
step on the lightnings and ascend

on the topmost step of the earth
stepping on the belt that surrounds the sphere

endless are the joys of the infinite quest
for the timeless explorer
and the child that lurks inside

on the topmost step of the earth
solo chris
stepping on the belt that surrounds the sphere

a billion toys to play countless more to invent
in the mental playground around its solid tree

the creators of the prophecies
have seen pages yet unturned
from a book that can not be read

on the topmost step of the earth

stepping on the belt that surrounds the sphere


 geometry in static


behold that a path is created from these traces of ink
letters join numbers
sounds come forth manifesting the plasticity
this is the direct outcome of the continuous war
the collision of the worlds of change and stability

one would sense the mind behind them
if only he could withdraw from the relentless alterations of its forms

i have swum against rivers of fallacy
chaotic symmetry
and have returned
from the point of weakness
to the root of triumph

between the circular entrances of spinning dark suns
i travelled with the company of a triangle
to the dark corners of cosmos

geometry in static

in frozen wells i left my seal for the future travellers
sunken trilithons bear my signature
in wombs of yellow on the phosphoric remnants
of organisims with consciousness long erosed

one would sense the mind behind them
if only he could withdraw from the relentless alterations of its forms

 shamanic rite


from inside a cloud with the shape of a grey owl
scanning down the hill of an indian scared site
i can see a figure with hair white like the snow
the polar crystal breath

gyrating around the pyre like a planet in orbit
around the burning mass of a life giving sun
following the ways of the ageless
parallel not our paths can cross
in a shower of meteor storm

as you have sung for me
now i sing for you
as you have welcomed me
now i welcome you

from inside a cloud with the shape of a grey owl

 heaven below


a peacock rests alone in the vitreous valley
with an innocent pose like it does not know
on its featheres ventaglia thousands of eyes
empty since the end of oracles

clouds create a hollow pillow
for sleepy heads to rest
by denying to submit to the whims
of their unstable paterns i glide above them all

heaven below

light as a thought dropping the weight of milleniums
how far can once reach
the answer depends on who this one is
how far can one extend
as far as his limits go

heaven below

 esoteric


a glimpse over this field of sorrow
its more than meets the eye
but in the eye of the beholder
its telling secrets and a lie
there is no room for mistakes
tresspassing to the point of no return
voices from within
are my only witnesses to this madness

the truth is hard to see here
as i am twisting your minds
if i fall
im taking it with me down
esoteric remains

all eyes on me
the logic beats the word
awaiting to see
endurance beats the restless
ill never give in
it would mean an impossible ending
the breakdown of me
must never occur
must never occur

a vague premonition
that is all there is
escalating to a nightmare
but heres nothing to see

a vague premonition
that is all there is
escalating into a nightmare
but heres still nothing to see

im giving you nothing instead of something
or was there anything i forgot
hesitation is never an option
then in a second its all over

the truth is hard to see here
as i am twisting your minds
when i fall
im taking it with me down
esoteric remains


 rise and decay


invested everything in expectations
gave away it all
infested is the outcome
but still its craving for more

consideration is
what is feeding it
an everlasting
stream of doubt
degeneration process
is commencing
and it is taking its toll

rise and decay
there is no escape

we should pay the price

in times like these
diminished in a second
the warning came to late
without reaching its final destination

no where
wanting caution for life
like a stab in the back
digging out everyone cheer

suppressed really
what is there more to see
suppressed

it was just an illusion

glancing with an empty stare
i just cannot believe
focus attention
this is for real this is now
by now there is no turning back
ones need is the others greed
no one walks away from this alive


 let the old world burn


embrace the darkness
as the night appears
a time i no longer fear
i inhale the cold air and feel how its soothing my soul one last time

banned from this world of silence
now lost to the world below
dont utter a word
just go
go

nevermore shall we return
me myself and i
its time to let the old world burn
its time to let go of control

at this point there is nothing holding us back
listen to the voice within
close your eyes and let go
feed the flames and watch them grow

banned from this world of silence
now lost to the world within
dont utter a word
just go
go

what is there to mourn
the effort was a waste
dont try to comprehend
answers there are none
answers there are none

exemption awaits
as the ending scene is closing in
go now
and forever be gone
a masterpiece of failure
your work here is done


 darkness descending


questions remain unanswered
the will to prevail grows stronger
to now know becomes a failure
proceeding with blindfolded eyes it seems

impossible to break through
decisions made to shatter this heaven
reluctantly its made so clear
that its never meant

to come in from another side
to have a lock from another angle
showing the signs of a great disaster
but who will master

the perception of life
reduced the further we go

witness another fall
indecision abundant
darkness descending
a disease neverending
scars burnt unto our skin

cover it all within
facing the facts in denial
lost to the creation of time
as allegiance is sworn

the inconvenience upon
is taking its toll

travel through excess
an evocative ride between evident fears

coming in from another side
having a lock from another angle
contemplating the great disaster
that no one will master

the timeline has come to an end
replace and proceed

witness another fall
indecision abundant
darkness descending
a disease neverending
scars burnt unto our skin
this is another fall
indecision abundant
darkness descending
a disease neverending
scars are one with our skin

one with our skin


 seclusion


the world moved out of my mind
i made it fiction
when i should have given it time
but still there was no caution
acting like someone else

restraining the bitterness
the ironwall wont give in easily
emptiness caught while burning
solitude live by learning

bargain for more
with every step further
withdraw from sanity
and make friend with misery
as the last ditch in this mystery

realizing the extent
watching destruction with grief
it will never be the same again
so where is the relief
where is the end


 miserys supremacy


when everythings pushed to the verge
frequently impatient
and you are searching for a way out
transparent indistinct
not always so obvious

the true colors are shining through
deterrent coherence
shifting to black or white
inverted inwardly
reveal the hidden side of you

like it wasnt enough
now burning at both ends
after this you just might be alone

beware
prepare
corroded grounds lying ahead
erasing is not the cure
the decision is all yours

its impossible to forget
what has been
pushed further down in the gutter
miserys supremacy

time has come to choose your side
restricted limited
the path is divided here
engender self defense
asking for a final solution
indirect incorrect
no matter how this turns out
horrid does disturbance
either way its a scar to heal

didnt know what to expect from the inception
resurrection
the damnation
must be broken must be broken

curse the inaccuracy
improvise a way out
to retrospect
you will know if
it was the right
thing to do then

deal with the existence
emptiness loneliness
you wont just go on after this
denial withdrawal
the illusion wont hold much longer

no it wasnt enough
burned out
now youre on your own
burned out


 under a pitch black sky


alternate reality
digging deeper and deeper
construct emptiness
out of nothingness
and erase the compassion
fragments in time
moments irreplaceable
whats yet to be found
surrenders to the ignorant

in order to be free
the mind is set to believe

under a pitch black sky
where the light is all so absent
with despair in sight
a growing form of indifference

in broad daylight
zombielike we walk
seconds in a decade
is giving life to the lifeless
its inside it fails
the diversion is relocating
and taking a new form
claiming for even more

construct emptiness
out of nothing
and erase the compassion
its inside it fails
the diversion is relocating
and taking a new form
claiming for more
even more

the skyline is fading
surroundings are lost
it is a distorted vision
addicted to those who proceed


 linger in doubt


everything can lose its meaning
sometimes there is a reason why

words on the screen
those words on the screen
revealing something and still
telling nothing
one sentence after another
searching for you

something is wrong here somebody must know
too torn inside to see it with non judging eyes
feed us more with these words on the screen
what do we do

where do we go
when answers run out
left alone
linger in doubt
nothing seems to make sense anymore
you disconnect from reality

searching just to find another way
to explain how and when where and why
do you deny
the words on the screen tell something different
do you chose to believe

when answers run out
left alone
linger in doubt
nothing seems to make sense anymore
you disconnect from reality

silence is broken again
awakening the monster inside

an indication got hold of you
it was seducing your mind
the first level is now clear
but lies got you nowhere

left alone
linger in doubt
nothing seems to make sense anymore
you disconnect from reality

when answers run out
left alone
linger in doubt
nothing seems to make sense anymore
you disconnect from reality


 the legacy of the defeated


so much in vain you might think
when its over everything is lost
too late to negotiate
accept or regret it
what once was so cold
is melting and vanishing

the grand scheme has failed
and the wrath has only begun
fierce and aggressive
its piercing through

who will remember
the legacy of the defeated
in the long run
its collecting years in the dust

overwhelmed by the massive appearance
a breathtaking setback
over and over
the last scene repeats
caught barehanded
and disarmed by reality

emptiness
silence
what is left
emptiness
and silence
is what is left
images slowly fading

truth detected
by others neglected
its like a virus spreading inside
eating itself out
whats written in blood
is worth nothing when its forgotten

bleed for my pain
revenge on treacherous snakes
they will pay

slicing the flesh
sculptured wounds my catharsis
i will stain

into the heart
needle injects gasoline
convulsions

the one that they betrayed
has made them this way

plagued by the bastards
i will kill you
killed by my rage

scream at my face
the grisly scars went unavenged
until now

deep in the hole
you are not gagged and scream aloud
but unheard

choke on your vomit
you watch your hands cut off
then your legs

the one that you betrayed
will kill you this way

scarred by the bastards
i will kill you
killed by my rage
i must kill you

into the throat
the scalpel slices
warm blood sprays out
the gushing entices

pull out your heart
and let you watch
shove in your mouth
then stab your crotch

i watch your agony

i am released
from years of pain
your death averted
my becoming insane
you are dead

i have killed you


 disposal of the body


music lyrics webster
vocal patterns fisher webster

the basement incinerator
is where theyll put the head
hose the floor and clean the room
anywhere they bled

into boxes go the bags
fill the space with rocks
in the dark of night
he throws them off the docks

rotting in the river
never to be found
under tons of concrete
deep beneath the ground

from behind he grabs his mouth
the blade goes to his neck
bulging veins pumping blood
he struggles to protect

if you dont cut open the stomach
the corpse will rise and float
the victim is discovered dead
rotting organs bloat

the killer chops the body
with a scalpel and an ax
the parts are then drained
and put into the sacks

grab the neck slit the throat take the life
hang the corpse  prepare to drain the blood

bone saw meat cleaver filleting knife
carve the corpse  dissect him in the tub

smash the teeth slice off scars crush the bones
with a crowbar  scrape off all tattoos

if you dont cut open the stomach
the corpse will rise and float
the victim is discovered dead
rotting organs bloat

the killer chops the body
with a scalpel and an ax
the parts are then drained
and put into the sacks

chunks of a skull
sawn in half bones
body is found
killer unknown

 blood drenched execution

blood drenched execution
carnage inspired by hatred and evil
fatalities the final solution
feel the fucking pain
i rip your child from your cunt
the fetus is kept alive
to die before caring eyes

slaves in hell for me
a tortured death will set you free
the executioner
i was meant to be
born to kill for all eternity

the exsanguination
savage display of murder and mayhem
casualities of primal abduction
red is spraying from
the hole in the babys head
the slaughter will not subside
this day a family dies

young blood is so pure
unborn infant is dead premature
the executioner
has to mutilate
a fetal pulp is all that remains

rapid blood loss
flooding the floor
gore is unstoppable
rabid blood lord
carving the whore
extremely contemptible
rancid rancor
insatiable from my proclivity
random tirade
eternal death inevitable

 gallery of suicide


music webster obrien
lyrics mazurkiewicz
vocal patterns mazurkiewicz fisher

into the abyss perpetual and torturous
the gallery of suicide internal torment
archaic carcasses displayed degeneracy
once within these walls a life of death will be unleashed

forever dying are the dead countless bleeding heads
cadavers splattered red from the selfslicing of necks
stenching maggot filled bodies skulls and bones rot away
the slaughtered souls that chose to die enveloped in death

darkness is the only light suicide the way
hideous forms of human death mounds of flesh slowly decay
embrace the horrid nature carnage on display

pain never felt
enslaved inside this massive grave
life evil fate
only slaves to death can survive this place
die perdition
penance in putrid decadence
dead miscreants

lyrics vocal patterns webster

her flesh decaying she rises to see
lecherous ghouls with rotting erections
her breasts are lactating blood and pus
an orgy of death cadavers of lust

gray skinned bodies pulsate as one
grasping her flesh erotic undead
maggots crawl on their rotting cocks
into her cunt rigid like rock

fucking the zombie whore
unite the dead
fucking the zombie whore
fornicate

breeding the damned
carcasses writhe
revel in death

bleeding and sore
insatiable corpse
consummate the bonds of death

beautiful eyes are now vacant pits
her body contorts her vagina has fangs
purtid fluids will mix in her loins
the seed of the undead will grow inside

hiding from mankind the embryo grows
nourished by flesh the mother consumes
after the birth the child will grow
prince of the dead conceived by profanity

fucking the zombie whore
unite the dead
fucking the zombie whore
fornicate

gifted with speech
the offspring will lead
establish their reign

lusting for flesh
but living not dead
the corpses will rape
rape

lascivious legions of blasphemous ghouls
kill to create whore of their own

lust of the dead will multiply
thousands of corpses beginning to rise
living again for rape and destruction
ejaculate bile from their erections

lascivious legions of blasphemous ghouls
kill to create whore of their own

solo  owen

kingdom of rot the bastard will rule
stinking of death zombies will roam
through the whore the world was crushed
an orgy of death cadavers of lust

licentious masses rejoicing in sin
larva faced sluts fucking the ghouls
the rancid bodies will copulate
their barren world they repopulate

fucking the zombie whore
unite the dead
fucking the zombie whore

 stabbed in the throat


music obrien
lyrics vocal patterns mazurkiewicz

as the blood begins to gush out the side of your neck
i thrust my cold steel into your face your closer to death
a twelwe inch blade will help decide your ultimate fate
this summons to die has been given to you for accepting my hate

stabbed in the throat
for no reason but to kill for no reason but the thrill
you must die for me to survive
stabbed in the throat
i believe in sacrifice sliced open with my knife
your body is now life deprived

vocal cords twitching esophagus severed a hemorrhaging brain
your lacerated jugular vein is spurting away
as mortality fades i am ready to flay your whole body and head
vigorously carving this fresh human flesh i am one with the dead

stabbed in the throat
for no reason but to kill for no reason but the thrill
you must die for me to survive
stabbed in the throat
i believe in sacrifice sliced open with my knife
your body is now life deprived

im chewing bloody skin from the cadaver
consuming lifeless meat mangled and tattered
halfeaten corpse lies skinless in the gutter
i am revitalized

odium embedded in my skull

to kill and eat your prey a way of nature
the taste of death must consciously be savored
my cannibal existence never dangered
just look into my eyes

subjugate intensity to blame

gnawing on the head sliced to fucking shreds
knife to the gullet results in cessation

stabbed in the throat
for no reason but to kill for no reason but the thrill
you must die for me to survive
stabbed in the throat
i believe in sacrifice sliced open with my knife

led to the place of atonement
repent through pain
slicing off proof of guilt

blood craving torturers revel
pain through penance
you will plead for your scourge

burnt with iron
retinas scorched
eyes are blind
purge the mind

enter the chambers of blood
slave to the cruelty inside
die in the chambers of blood
cleansed of the sins of your lifebleeding

walls are stained with blood of vice
learn through scourge
the errors of depravity

immortal curse
inquisitors for eternity
scourging to learn
the stamina of the condemned

disembowel
torn apart
heaving lungs
severed tongues

never to speak evil never again
this is the way it must be
burnt at the stake or
stretched on the rack
burning your soul
draw out your guilt

pieces torn off
pieces that sinned
tumors that must be destroyed
chop off a cock or carve out a cunt
cleansing your soul bleed to atone

enter the chambers of blood
slave to the cruelty inside
die in the chambers of blood
cleansed of the sins of your life

bleed on its infernal walls
nailed to the prison you made
scraps of flesh litter the halls
torture the price has been paid

preparing for medieval demise
a makeshift guillotine out of burcher knives
ill watch her body quiver from the chaos
peel off her face and frantically chew her eyes

she finally enters my dwelling of sin
itll be done in a matter of minutes
as i embrace her for one last single time
in horror i realize death is mine

i feel the cold blade pierce the back of my neck
the blood spews incessantly flooding my face
convulsions and spasms as life fades away
ironically im the one with no head

bones broken in half
blood flowing freely
limbs severed in hate

skin eaten in wrath
eyes ripped from your head
lie shattered you die

for believing you could be free
weakness only invigorates me
these broken bones once yours i hold
cause of death will never unfold

torn mangled and maimed
life withers away
in hellish decay
bones shattered you die

for not seeing things i see
your pummeled body strengthens me
these broken bones keep me aware
of how i lust to shred and tear

every bone broken is my only goal
sucking the marrow of your fractured femurs
every bone broken your truculent toll
succumbling to my offensive demeanor
every bone broken enhances my soul
your twisted corpse is contorted dead rot
every bone broken your life i stole
ill kill again and ill never get caught

the snapping and cracking of skeletal remains
the pleasure of devouring decomposed flesh
the feeling of power from crushing your skull

i slaughtered your body and returned it to dirt
not a trace of proof that you ever existed

ill kill again and ill never get caught

gouges and hacks at the man of disgrace
tearing off muscles from the bones of his chest
rending his flesh with rage ive been blessed

chopped off the tongue that told the lies
i spit on him and laugh while he dies
lying there helpless i throw brick at your head
starving for violence and now ive been fed

his blood drips from my mouth
i bit his larynx out
biting off fingers when he tried to push me back

his blood drips from my mouth
i bit his larynx out
biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
chopping at his face in hate i gouge and hack

crushing the despised

under my boot i hear your bones crack
so many things that you want to take back
i wont forget and i wont forgive
not so long as i allow you to live

chopped off the tongue that told the lies

 coffinfeeder


music and lyrics  a webster

exhume the rotted casket
robbing graves
but not for wealth
cloaked in moldy rags
hunting dead
decrepit things from hell
invade the sacred tombs
search for food
embalmed five days before
ancient body stealers
raid again
a fresh corpse beyond the door
from the ground they rise
plundering the grave
when the faithful die
its them not god they meet
consume the rotted body
and unt more
craving maws ooze blood
gray skinned coffinfeeders
seekig carrion
eat the old ones last
fiendish ghouls are chewing
scraps of meat
found inside the tomb
roy veiled messengers
from beyond bring the parish doom

from the ground they rise
plundering the grave
when the faithful die
its them not god they meet

unholy creatures swarming the coffin
fighting for mouthfuls of flesh
invading the tombs of the recently buried to feast
starvation of aeons sated tonight
foraging ghouls consume
ancient hunger awakened again

solo  owen

strengthened by blood the undead attack
septic beats from the grave
if living approach they are devoured too
fragments of corpses nourish the pack
fresh entrails they crave
the coffin is torn open the zombies start to consume

from the ground they rise
plundering the grave
when the faithful die
its them not god they meet


 hacksaw decapitation


music  p obrien lyrics  p mazurkiewicz

memory of the insane
of killing in so man ways homicidal
seeking redemption through rage
with hacksaws i decapitated them all
blood covers the groud my feet are saturated
rotting flesh scattered around i feel no remorse
i dont remember my name
or when blood of the dead flowed so relentlessly
extracting the brains from the skulls
my anger evolves with the more heads i deform
sawing the neck i am engulfed in fantasy
chew the esophagus cannibal delicacy
utterly execerbated forver deleterious
slicing through skin sundered larynx veins spraying blood
tattered windpipe facial carvings another head to abhore 
beheading sustains my desire
enhancing my primitive mind
annihilation without repreving

 condemned to agony

butchering the helpless
was his way of life
uncontrolled rage
internal strife
the pain he dealt out was never repaid
retribution was sought by the ones he had slain
infernal phantasm
condemned to agony
no escape after death
condemned to agony
heads of his victims
have returned to haunt
dripping with blood
rotted and gaunt
the pain is reflected to him after death
with the victis of his knife he is now beset
reliving every crime
condemned to agony
no escape from their hate
condemned to agony agony
he thought he got away
his crimes unpunished he took them to the grave
their tortured souls are waiting
now they make him pay
exact their revenge using methods that he used
to make him understand them

to chop him up
is their revenge
with no remorse
they slash him disfigure

undying hate
his torment endless
hes torn apart and they cut the pieces smaller
the knife he used to maim
is turned against him and now they will do the same
dissect the man of evil
his fingers are cut off
and forced into his mouth so that he cannot scream
and in pain they revel

piles of heads lie on the ground

without mercy savage killers throw

from many wounds blood begins to flow

when the victim dies
they chop off his head

bady beaten in a daze

mangeld face a mass of lumps
what was now a man reduced to mush

mashed into a pulp

staking out the residence

entering the empty home
lace the food with poision

the hapless victim never had a chance
precise contamination killed him fast

shocking news traveld fast

death i dont regret

analyze the next assignment
select the proper tools
gas will be the most effective

enclosed space filled with poision gas

face fixed with dispair
but the end does not seem close
misjudged the lethal dose

cant leave him in a coma

completion of the murder ends his pain

 festering in the crypt


eyes tied tight forever
mouth wired shut forever
body parts dissever you will see no more
never

lowerd into the ground
you will never hear another sound
in your coffin you are bound underground
forever

to the earth youre now enslaved to the creatures long depraved
flesh has now turned to grey as the larve gnaw away
as you rott in your smallish tomb insects care not how you met your doom
in your casket eternally lie many were pleased to see you die

fester
in the
crypt where
you lie

victims
pass by
they watched
you die

flesh melts off your frame infamous was your name
years passed since you moved on
nothing left buy carrion

festering in the crypt


 nothing left to mutilate


as i walk behind her her scent trails to me
what is it that draws me neared what could it be
once i was normal among the sheep
now im immortal in the night i creep

searching for the one  she will run from the gleam of my blade she has strayed
she will pay with the only life that she now knows
captured by the gender she loathes

now she is tied terrified set aside
as i prepare she stares as i tear at the garment she hides behind
her young flesh is so devine

one final deed she will plead i proceed
satisfying my urge i will scourge as i surge through her hallowed feminine domain
from her young body i cant abstain

lifeless she now lies now untied i defile
carefully scoring her skin i begin from within
removing her organs inspected
still nothing detected

solo jack owen

one way to achieve
the info that i need
continuing to cleave

solo jack owen

gradually consumed
she was foredoomed
body one big wound

now i am through as i chew on the few pieces that remain
of the brain nothing gained i continue my
searching in the night for the one who fulfils my plight

searching for the one  she will run from the gleam of my blade she will pay
nothing left to mutilate
nothing left to mutilate

 rotted body landslide


climbing the mounds to escape from death
ten thousand left to rot
in this gorge

bodies lie
putrety
i wont die

suffocating stench of corpses warfts
up from the bits of deaths
fumes disgorge

rancid heap
walls steep
vapors creep

underneath
putrid tide
rotted body
land

slide
genocide
mountains of dead mark the place where they died they died

transfixed with horror as the corpses fall
flesh sloughs off as i try to grasp
start to slip

suffocate
corpses weight
steals my fate

underneath
putrid one
rotted body

genocide
anguish eternally fixed in their eyes
rotted body

avalance of cadavers down the mountainside

smother me with rot
remains are crushing me
decomposing mound

this is where i die
nameless dead my witness

 slain


the outlander walked into town coverd in gore
he knew he could not wait much longer he needed more
death
pain
terror
blood

on the high plain they lost their lives
hundreds were slain
why they died no one will know
their bloodstains weill allways show for all time

wasting no time he began defiling whores
he would be the last man they felt a carnivore
tear
rape
ravage
maim

on the high plain they lost their lives
hundreds were slain
why they died no one knows
their bloodstains will always show for all time

firing loaded rifle never ending killing spree
slashing with machette body parts are the debris
there is no escape he holds your fate as the death rate climbs to the fullest extent
one more town slowly going down
this is the comming of endless torment

solo jack owen

unburied victims lie blood soaking into the sand
remains of the slain a dead body wasteland
there is no escape he holds your fate as the death rate climbs to the fullest extent

 bent backwards and broken


twisting limbs untill they break
contortions wrenching pain

joints are hyperextended
opposite
fibrous tendons snap
bent
backwards and broken

hateful physical control
opposite ways
elbows bend and pop
fingers cracking
connective tissue torn

unrelenting warping strain
knees are shattered
sinew ripped from bone
ankles give way

back is arching
spinal pressure builds
total collapse

predacious entanglement form is distorted
grotesque rearrangement body contorted

splintering bones causing internal bleeding
abundance of injuries pain is exceeding

every joint in the body is turned the wrong way
a debt to the nemesis forcibly paid

arching the back
vertebrae crack
fracture the spine
cant realign

torque on the neck
structure is wrecked
amorphous blob
an end to macabre

stretching the body in every direction
forcing the joints unnatural flexion

 they deserve to die


violence is legitimate is causes such as this
cruel retribution is fitting
vengeance will be dealt out with ruthless iron fist
worthless filth recieve no mercy

they deserve to die
they deserve to die

plans have been completed and the time is drawing near
punishment will be relentless

they deserve to die
they deserve to die

vacuous faces hammered into mash
beaten senseless sense they never had
merciless smashing shatters teeth and bone
ignorance earned every crushing blow

killing has just started and my lust for blood will grow
justice will be found in murder
stupid as they are they didnt know the seeds theyd sown
grew into my savage hatred

they deserve to die
they deserve to die

skull is fractured by the pounding
eyes dislodging from their sockets
brains spill out the skull is split through
mind vacent now cranium too

guilty thoughs will not infect me
soulless scum recieve no pitty

deceptive tounges hewn by my blade
forked like a snake now on the ground they lay
they had no conscience so there is no loss
for my redemption there must be a cost

 high velocity impact spatter


climbing
heights unimagined unattained
to drop bodies from the sky
falling
alive in mid air moving fast
heads exploding on the ground
throwing
corrupted souls in front of trains
just to watch the bodies fly
grinning
at the site of shredded innards
brains exploded all around

slamming
you into walls excessive speed
creates catastrophic sounds
scraping
fresh blood and guts from off the pavement
before stench of death sets in
piercing
between the eyes and unexpected
liquid red spraying behind

something i will always need

stalking the living to feast upon the flesh

the world you once knew forever changed
scavenging just to stay alive

 a skeletal domain


trapped beneath rotting remains
a slow decay of life takes its form

withered death and bone emerge
from cemeteries of the earth
replacing all that is known from this world

towering structures take shape
as more cities are laid to waste

survivors of this morbid fate

are left to start a new
misshapen and half mutated
not a zombie not a human
evil creatures grew

not one thing left alive but them
the strongest will begin to reign

a new society takes place
where the way of the cannibal
rules in this skeletal domain

a kingdom of the damned

carnal war consuming them by
eating flesh for nourishment
solution for a shortterm survival

slaughtered are the weakest first
feeding those with evil thirst
as blood of the dead saturates the ground

again the end has begun
another kingdom will be damned

 headlong into carnage


no hesitation as the bloodshed begins
frenzied violence raging death
devastation as the killers
savagely murder all in sight

mutilators swarming hacking off limbs
falling bodies severed heads
pure destruction by the mob
butchering all that they can see

honing their insanity
headlong into carnage without fear
ruthless human weapons with no conscience unaware

rampaging killers slash with furious hate
bones are breaking blood is spilled
mutilation feeds their hunger
brutally killing satisfied
relentless slaughter innards hang from their blades

disembowelment of their prey
in the bloodbath all their vile
dreams will come to pass

weaponized psychopathy
headlong into carnage seeking blood
seething minds distorted by the violence and pain

driven by adrenaline
headlong into carnage they attack
merciless and brutal take the head off of your neck

sweat flies while throats are cut
tendons snapping sinew tearing
blood pours from gaping wounds
sadistic chaos grips you

fractured cheekbones shattered skull
bludgeoning without remorse

 the murderers pact


coercion and threats
made their demands
held the past over my head
one mistake has made me their tool
blackmailing a means to the end im forced into the pact

murderer
is this what i am

homicide
how can i stop this

not a violent man but now im forced to kill
seems to be no other way
trapped by an accident tragic and fatal
the crime was unintentional but this i cannot prove

is there no way out

suicide
is that the answer

desperation
deal has been made
no turning back
im bound to kill by the murderers pact

steel myself for the task at hand
preparing the tools that i need
sharpen the blades make the kill quick
extortion drove me to the deed i take from it no joy

murderer
now i will do this

i have made my choice

sins of the past
haunt me today
should have confessed

motive concealed
undetected
hunting him down
his life will end
im bound to kill by the murderers pact

thrust of the blade repulses
commit the heinous crime
stabbing him repeatedly
gouge his neck slash his face

see his look of terror
he knows his time has come
cannot show him mercy
make him die finish it

corpse left to rot

his mother is behind me
puts her hand on my shoulder

a day of mourning fuels annihilation
i will kill them all by funeral cremation

relatives must die
of the man i killed
one by one destroyed
nothing left when it is over
torment deep inside
to be unleashed on those inside
ending with his kids
blood is flowing from their bodies

in with my cruelty
erase the present
to forget the past

affectations

victims bend to my will

passed through generations
murderous ways
proclivity for violence

murder a fascination
dispatching those who trust
my compulsion

fleeting fulfillment
no joy will ever last

the soulless walk among you
concealed by deceit
smiling when i face you
slashing when you turn

denied me a soul

your pleas cannot move me
no mercy to give
i seek domination

emotionless cold

 bloodstained cement


stalking his prey
he prepares for the ambush
i hear his steps
but without trepidation
hyper aware
i will strike back

when he brandished the blade
gave his intentions away

back to the wall i have no choice
its time to fight or die
i will respond with overwhelming force
a switch turns on and i must survive

fearless resolve
as i spring into action

quickly disarm
and remove his advantage
only one thing on my mind
stop his attack

now hes on the defense
momentum is shifting my way

a savage brawl i hear his voice
pure terror in his cries
break his balance slam him to the ground
following through to stay alive

landing multiple blows
the blood is starting to spray

will not stop till i am sure
the threat has been put down
raining down with forearm thrusts
torrents of blood flow from his eyes
bloodstained cement

no weakness to exploit
his ambush failed
hammer fists break facial bones
knuckles bleed from shards of teeth

smash his skull onto the pavement
make the bastard pay
dont stop until it cracks
and spills out his brain

bloodstained cement

solo obrien

when he chose me as prey
a fatal mistake was made

consequences of his choice
led to his bloody end
warning potential assailants
target you choose could be your death

such a grisly display
the ultimate price has been paid

standing breathless i see him
dead in a pool of blood
never again will he terrorize
executed by his final mark

 hollowed bodies


putrid mess lays in the woods
removed of organs and meat
 mounds of bony flesh
hollowed out except for maggots
that dwell
deep inside the skulls
of victims that they cleaned
how did this horror unfold

no trace of evidence was left behind
at this scene of gore
will the truth ever be told

only time will tell

will there be more to find
some more hollowed bodies
will there be more to find some more hollowed bodies
with their untold stories

cadavers rot
cadavers rot hollowed

 more corpses are found
 miles exactly south
 more to the north
 stacks of  humans
 miles apart from one another
in a line
why did this horror unfold

 more
 to the west
 to the east make  in total
will the truth ever be told

only if i tell

will there be more to find
some more hollowed bodies
will there be more to find some more hollowed bodies
with their untold stories

cadavers rot
cadavers rot hollowed

bodies were found

i cannot hide from life or death
i want to be alone

dig your way to misery
spark eternal hatred
burn all bridges
set it free

 goat father


goatfather�s son
sacred holy words of loyalty claiming your salvation
when the timing of the rulers of your life is depending that their words
are truly reviling you from pain you feel when you wait to die
your pain

blinded you sacrifice your mind for their beheading
of all you are when time is running out
a soldier nothing but a piece in the puzzle
lead by those you should not have trusted with your life

with violence our life is measured up against the idea of pride
you forget your quest for the new ideas to fill your daily needs
no one lives for anything but earthly matters
no protection is given you if you don�t become a slave
in time

now face the sewer

words end

so come extinction

no lies
hope
dies

the mindless weep polluted tears

the shapeless crawl in cancer soil
the melting earth still breaths

heed the call the distorted grin

now face the sewer

but pain and death
dont look for love

 human garbage

forced to be silent

human garbage
to be destroyed

submit to darkness
forced to conform

human garbage
to be destroyed

your mind is dead
your thoughts are void

human garbage
to be destroyed


 you suffer


you suffer
but why


 life


brought into this emptiness
never hope or choice
emotionless and cold
this is life

illusions shattered
an existence of lies
a constant struggle
freedom denied

at their feet  submission
no sanctuary in death
drugged up fucked up
is that all youre worth


 prison without walls


trapped  inside your head
insular living dead

existing for a purpose youll never find
inducements distortions command your mind

external sources maintain control
programmed existence fulfill your role

youve got a brain shake off the reins
smash the shackles break the chains


 point of no return


systematic rape of nature
profit precedes need
maintaining economic stature
steal the fruit yet leave no seed

and of future generations
what of their inheritance
a world of contamination
poisoned by our ignorance

oblivious to reality
conscience spurned
beyond the point of no return


 negative approach


nothing i can say
that hasnt already been said
generic words  thoughts
similarly expressed

this primitive stance
feelings of angst
matters relating
to circumstance

unfounded action 
just part of the faction
conform i wouldnt give you
the satisfaction


 success


climb the ladder your security
upward social mobility

consume the lies its what you need
vicious circle of mindless greed

where is your success gained from
what of the lives youre shat upon
caught in the web youll play the game
an artifical life but whos to blame


 deceiver


becoming weary of your lies
you disguise the truth belies

only fooling yourself

pretend to bite the hand that feeds
but you wont discard your security

the transparency of your fantasy

 divine death


cleansing impurity
seizure of insecurity

divine death

individuality disabled
blinded by fables

divine death

easy prey
you will pay
mourn lifes loss
rotting on that cross

divine death


 as the machine rolls on


hiding behind symbols
selfdelusion
plenty of questions
and no solutions

visions of change
a mere illusion
futile dreams
of revolution

flows of rhetoric
wont influence change
their will is subdued
their minds enslaved


 common enemy


bitching
backstabbing
senseless infighting

united we stand
divided we fall
the common enemy that overshadows us all


 moral crusade


a superiority complex
pious holy to the hilt
outwards displays of cleanliness
masking inner feelings of hate and guilt

your morality is hypocrisy
obsessive selfesteem
enforcing your ideals
your puritanical dream

gather your flock
gullible fools
dictate restrictions


 stigmatized


blissfully ignorant
content and unaware
not your problem
why should you care

not normal
an easy target for release
infected from birth
this sickening disease

you sanctimonious slime
understanding discarded
the truth is clear
its you thats retarded


 mad


stark bleak wasted
devastated

when

all life
totally annihilated

die

does it have to be this way
is this the price were gonna pay


 dragnet


the ascension of human intelligence
to atomic genocide

homo sapiens  the disease the cause the pollution
erase the aeons of evolutions

pushed too far just a matter of time
seemingly nothing to halt the tide

except the end  accept the end

 venator


as i skulked past the gates
and drew behind the stones
the winding trees enveloped
the cloak around my bones

peering through the nights mist
i crept through the fen
to try and find the totem
in the grey wargs den

the freezing forest guards
the secrets that he wrought
his spirit lies on every twig
his scent infests the haunt

his howling cut the still air
his cry up to the stars
the piercing bay of his rage
tore the beat out of my heart

to the entrance
i stalked up in the shadows
his breathing i could hear
rasping in the barrows

silently my dagger slid
from its icecracked sheath
his bloody maw emerging
his jowls hung raw beneath

like those that lusted below me
my mind was always snared
the totem drew my senses
the grey warg drew my fear

his giblet eyes surveyed me
his haggard haunch was raised
rearing up his splintered paw
he struck me in a daze

and with his jaws jarred open
he tore me on the floor
as lonely bones forgotten now
i lay here evermore


 from scythe to sceptre


i knew you some years before
deep in prayer under bough
futile sighs in vital skin
your flesh caressed by night

yet change came quickly
a bruise in the air it staggered within
sweet sickly rot
black wound infection

king slave child
your fates are united
an unending row to the grave
a single dance now all eyes are shut
blind to the earthly

begging now to forget who i am
emperor your sword is useless
shattered crowns so swiftly
fragile as the scythe

aching bones cling to swollen limbs
despair floods all senses
the world is dying around me

gaping in mirth his old eyes spoke
where you are now  i once was
and what i am now  you soon will be
nothingness awaits you

begging now to regain what ive lost
the tale of life is but a picture
a flash in an abyss a dream in the void

see that there is no meaning
understand eternal death
you long now to try what you once feared
but the time is gone and dust will be your legacy


 outlive the hand


in death she spoke of waiting
her final days were long
these fields have changed since last she wept
before the silent throng

she sits where childhood memories lie
above beside within them
the carvings have outlived the hand
which bled to first begin them

as features of the landscape merge
the oldest trees are falling
awareness sweeps the view aside
she stares as if recalling

seen first beyond the canopy
they soon had reached the borders
the clouds infused with burning breath
arrived from coldest corners

the windswept valley hastens now
as dying words are uttered
from lips of earth and saplings strain
like leaves her last thoughts fluttered

again it darkens overhead
the knowledge of it stills me
and when the water starts to fall
preserve the drop that kills me


 suns delusion


descending through thickened mist
an old man reached inside and tore out my slumber
ivory twists an open claw
set upon the skulls of man

formative years aside
truth blanched in suns delusion
but providence affirmed
destroyed my aberration
mortal seeds in divine
gave grief into lifes form

and so curved the spine
obeisance made before him
blessed in life but truly cursed by death
bitter choice befalls you
glory lord of men asks but pain

masters stone was weaved
compelled before the throne
then war came a semblance of her
lands unite and he prospers

grand signs assail me
temptation yields assent
as irons carve the sand
a ruse brings fate upon him
anguished price for laurels
veins burnt by hatred
in premonitions menis consumed me

unsanctified i cared nothing for their ways
yet a fathers plea dragged mercy from me

now demigod echo in eternity
a toxic toll pierces the flaw
on reflection there was never any choice


 held in hollows


through tainted mass
a scourge unseen
brought three winters forth
and set between

after these hundreds of years
the embers and fate will collide
her rotten heart has burst
and shattered through dead wood

when they drank from the earth the end was near
tracing paths that once ran alone and pure
suffused within the blighted decay
now snapped into dust their splinters fall

but a tithe to the wind his frail grasps
clawed for the moon then came undone
when all hope fails in the last broken bough
her strength will be gone

churning ash and husks in the bitter winds
crack the earth and burn the sky
a wry procession of hubris
where nothing remains

but everything changes
in destruction she will create

arising in glory the searing gaze
crimsonhanded specter of death
under the blood eye of furies
bury their feeble hearts


 husks




 aspect


name the aspect of oblivion
that instilled in you such dread
in the moment that was waiting
where the causal chain had led

describe the pure finality
of that twisted cold eruption
and attempt to comprehend
unparalleled destruction

unclench your teeth and meet your demise
behold the fate you always desired

standing on the brink we see our home is lost
a sacrifice led to the slaughter
black flickers grit the cusp
hands clasped under falling soil

drip down faintly by dark whispers
a torrent into madness

blunt nails shred the life from your face
fetid strips of decaying hope
drift down gently

in obsidian water
your pale arms reach for me
beckon me closer

in silence at last
a peace we always wanted
we cease to be


 countless skies


countless times below me
rivers rose and fell
ageless stones eroding out
across the endless swell

songs to pave the seasons
wounds to follow birth
cries to carry through the night
wombs to feed the earth

countless skies above me
each unlike the next
lines of more than moon and sun
glimpses of a text

countless hands have sought me
reaching out in vain
permanence observes without
compassion or disdain

flames to greet the harvest
storms to face in awe
winds to weave through every wood
walls to dull the road

purpose lost to frailty
craning blades of grass
strength and weakness on and on
all that is will pass

countless hands have sought me
reaching out in vain
permanence observes without
compassion or disdain

flames to greet the harvest
storms to face in awe
winds to weave through every wood
walls to dull the road

countless waves around me
strong until the last
leaning into dimming dreams
all that was has passed

 ride with me


the killer awoke before dawn
he put his boots on
he took a face from the ancient gallery
and he walked on down the hall
he went into the room where his sister lived and he
he paid a visit to his brother and then he
he walked on down the hall yeah
and he came to a door
and he looked inside
father yes son i want to kill you
he said what
and mother i want to

i want to fuck you
for what you put me through
so what you got
so fuck you
its coming back to you
so what you got

the other night i was out riding in a friends car
and out there on the side of the road
there was this snake
this snake had eyes of fire and fangs from another world
but he was selling something
he was selling devotion
he was selling dreams he was selling lifestyles
and i said sure man what you got
im interested in anything thats gonna get me off
and the snake just stood there and smiled with the spit in his eye and cried

fuck you
for what you put me through
so what you got
so fuck you
its coming back to you
so what you got

he was selling dreams and he was selling lies
i met the prisoner of my own device
he was selling love he was selling bliss
he sold me anything i could not resist
ride with me
ride with me
ride with me
ride with me

i had the freedom to live how i wanted
to take what i wanted to take
from anyone at any time
forever in heartache
as the snake just stood there and smiled
at my demise
i wasnt scared

so fuck you
for what you put me through
so what you got
so fuck you
for what you put me through
so what you got


 red harvest


how many people can i hate in my mind
with an intention of murder
have the people fear me
the people bleeding

once theyre conditioned its easy to provoke aggression
this premonition is evil

killing begets more killing
the blood lust begins
killing begets more killings
the blood lust begins

what kind of visions can i build in my mind
to harvest the hearts of the people
to create the fever you need a reason

once theyre conditioned its easy to provoke aggression
this premonition is evil

killing begets more killing
the blood lust begins
killing begets more killing
the blood lust begins

it makes me feel alive in my eyes
it makes all the pain subside

just out after sunset
i take a walk down the streets
ya know try to clear the head
and i feel like i gotta put my fist upon the wall
feel the cold concrete as it tears apart my knuckles

i am not afraid
and if i should die tonight that would be just fine

the bastard is ripe and fit for the bleeding
death from above death from above

certain death signs of a hysteria
confusion on the way to the way to the gates
terror among the ranks

submissionrelentless
obliterated from the past
fire destruction now theres no turning back

 whiskey bent and hellbound hellmyr


lookin out upon the highway already  miles gone
i take my first taste of freedom and ive never felt so alive yeah

and out of the corner of my eye i see a woman
well she was more radiant than i ever could have imagined
and she was singing whats wrong with you

cause everything and everyone is old hey hey hey
i cut my lung out i need a fix
youre my puzzle and my pieces fit
cause everything and everyone is old hey hey hey
the nights in the desert paint pictures that arent always what they seem
the dust kicking up all around it makes this shit come on like a whirl wind
and she stands up on the hood of my car
and she screams to all my team and says murderer

i wanna see chaos wanna see victims be one with the pain
the power of our redemption supresses the memories of tragedy

oh give me what i need
let me drift away

where are the troubles all my troubles are so far away

well get me back get me back on the road
i met the devil and i sold my soul
cause everything and everyone is old hey hey hey

how does it feel how does it feel to be numbered


 killing time


weapons engaged
the satellites have their position
the threat is imminent
we have proof and probable cause
strike and we shall be victorious

let the killing begin
heres where the killing begins

your orders are clear to search and destroy
leave nothing alive
women and children are collateral damage
in keeping them nothing can be gained
to destroy them is no loss at all

let the killing begin
heres where the killing begins

no there aint no hope
there is no feeling left in this heart of stone
and so it goes set to explode
we are the killing machine set to unload

we now reserve the right to invade your homes and
seize your properties and search your persons at will
meanwhile your ports are a gaping hole
the casualties will be enormous

let the killing begin
heres where the killing begins

no there aint no hope
there is no feeling left in this heart of stone
and so it goes set to explode
we are the killing machine set to unload

now that youre surrounded
and cut off from all support
the nemesis rises as the targets acquired
and you look upon the sky and pray
to the gods above
to the gods above

no there aint no hope
there is no feeling left in this heart of stone
and so it goes set to explode
we are the killing machine set to unload


 truth thicker than water


i wanna wake up with a reason to celebrate i wanna wake up before its too late
i wanna hear that song on the radio
spinning around my head like a halo

as i fade to another place where i dream while im still awake
i feel shame as i waste away
i sip this cheap champagne
its just another day

hey old man you used to live for the heroin
you were a shooting star leaving impressions
now youre sitting alone in your rocking chair
wishing you could rock it right out of there

as i fade to another place
where i dream while im still awake
i feel shame as it waves away
i see think that shes still blind
its just another day

its hopeless devotion it drags me down and weighs a thousand pounds
im drowning in all these lies how can this be true i have been denied x
its hopeless i have been denied x
how can this be true
i have been denied denied

these times they mean so much its all about love and family
no one can ever hold us down
no one can ever hold us back
stuck it out through all the hardships but troubled times have come our way but in the end well prevail
i accept the challenge to change our destiny gouge out your eyes and judge us blind
we refuse to take your judgements and your lies
the lives youve turned away will be your true demise
but this is something you will not take from me its in my heart forever
forever
and now the time has come for us to rise again too bad it came to this settle the score


 demonstrating my style


youve only got one life make sure you do it right
no promises for the future no promise for tonight
when youre gone theres no coming back make sure you leave here knowing that his love is the only way
not doing anything about it is a choice being a good person wont do
but accepting the pain and burden carried for you
sin is life and life is sin
knowing your forgiven for it comes from within
living and dying with the choices youve made
save us oh god from the enemy that strikes on sight
save me from myself oh god as i lay down to sleep tonight
let me rest in your arms as i take my last breath
let me rest in your arms tonight as i take my last breath of life
let me rest in your arms
let me rest in your arms tonight
as i take my last breath
as i take my last breath of life


 know when to hold em


and weve worked so hard over the years to get where we are
now theres no turning back so well keep on keepin on
some said we wouldnt amount to anything but were here to prove you wrong and good things come to those who wait
 years later still goin strong
never stopping until its over always fighting this endless battle
and all the choices that weve made are left behind
the promise of truth isnt hard to reach in and find
but were falling apart cant you see the truth thats always been lying right here in plain sight for you to see
one fight
put on your armour fight for your life


 not another teen love song


i didnt think that it would come to this i never thought what we had would end this way
i gave and all you did was take from me this was nothing but a game to you
but i refuse to live in the past
im moving on to better things than you
with you i was weak but now my strength it is renewed
this game you played is over now
never again will i mistake lust for love
this game you played with my heart is over now
so as i lay down to sleep tonight i will pray that you find what youre looking for but my seeking is over for i have returned to my true first love


 sundress


my eyes wander in their blindness
my eyes consume truth
take this time to decide my beliefs and stay true
take this time to look inside my heart and find
if you look among the masses you will find that sex lust lies and greed only bring pain
just remember where your heart lies and never let it fail or die
my god im yours


 hammer to nail


the time had come to make the ultimate sacrifice the bitter cup would not be removed
through betrayal and denial you never said a word
as the flesh was ripped from your back you never said a word
as you walked to your execution you saw man at his worst
your silence spoke volumes and your path was unshaken
thorns embedded in flesh sweat burning open wounds
tortured by the ones you were dying for
hammer to nail
nail to flesh
blood flowing crimson red to was white
with dying breath asking forgiveness for our murders
all this for a world of imperfection and sin
all for a world who would deny your existence
a world that could never deserve grace and mercy
but yours abounds unending love for an unworthy world


 know when to fold em


this one goes out to my friends family
the ones that have been there through thick and thin
being true and standing tall helping me pick myself up whenever i fall
family extends farther than blood having my back when push comes to shove
a forever bond that cant be broken
the words ive said couldnt go unspoken
i make this vow to you my friends well stick this out until the bitter end
nothing will ever break our tie my life for yours no greater love have i
our friendship will stand the test of time


 saturday night in dixie


your life is nothing but a shadow of your lies come on rip off your disguise and realize
that you always gotta push forward
perfect sinful disease sickness it eats us
always progress never reject
scars are here to show me whats next
this is a war this is a fight that i may sleep when i lay tonight
where will it be
struggle to see all that is left in store for me
let us forget where we were at and all that is holding us back
holding us back
and everytime i turned away from you and everytime your faithfulness proved true
evil days keep plaguing my whole life but this time i think im ready for this life i know im ready for the fight


 a variety of damage


we will set this world ablaze
everyone has the chance to make a difference everyone has a chance to change
when you retrace the steps of your life will you have used every opportunity given
mediocrity is a choice that you must not make
take your chance to make a change be an example of whats within
live what you preach and preach what you live
let your words be the spark but let your actions be the flame that will burn the truth into the world
dont let your silence be a tool for the enemy
always speak the truth
and with the flame of the truth burning within our hearts we will set this world ablaze


 i may have been born yesterday but i stayed up all night


dont confuse taste for truth our blood still burns like fire
dont get caught up in the way we rock its just a ruse to get us close to you
dont be startled by the way we rock we tear down walls new york to cedar falls
soon you will see the there is no one truth trust us this is not a game
prepare end is coming soon the judgement of the strong and weak judgement of the strong and weak
fade away into another reality fall asleep wake up and smell the agony
dead where you stand

 apocalypse


since i was a child i saw my own way
who is god and who is not

im so sick of hearing you preach about heaven
all this bullshit about paradise

read all the signs

the christians must be stopped
from spreading all the lies
the only way to get to them
without fear when the sun is a god
have mercy
its the ending of your life

as my mind slips away
i see no end of this misery
the only truth is myself
i cant go on this way
no

read all the signs
youre the sign

are you forgetting
to the end of the rainbow
my own
all alone i know wont ill be there
no

with a stab in the back
have mercy
its the end of your life

when the son is the path
have mercy
its the ending of your life


 mind corruption


out they come to your rescue
to drag you off the street
they gave you food and shelter
theyll leave you to bleed

theyll take all your money
destroy all your goals
theyre killing for religion
then go lookin for more

wretched scum of the earth
they are waiting for rebirth
a relief from this labor
but they need a slave to do the work
you want an answer
they will use you til you die
theyll brainwash and convince you
that you will end up in paradise

the day is old
they see through your mind too
down and out
you cant see up out of the gloom

another way to bullshit the youth
to burn all the lies
they fill you up with this bullshit
they will make you lie

then theyll cover the earth
they are waiting for rebirth
a relief from this labor
but they need a slave to do the work
you want an answer
they will use you til you die
theyll brainwash and convince you
that you will end up in paradise

ah

wretched scum of the earth
they are waiting for rebirth
a relief from this labor
but they need a slave to do the work
you want an answer
they will use you til you die
theyll brainwash and convince you
you will end up in paradise
liars

cant imagine the pain inside of you
cant take the violence shooting through
unleash your rage pounding fear into their eyes

neuroses piercing through your head again and again
cant take the fuckin pain

bury your dead

no remorse for the victims massacred
theres no end to this twisted killing spree
now come to terms with the rage that blinds your eyes

transparent forcedon guilt
wont reconcile
their distorted values
fucks your pride

appease your fevered mind
recoil from selfpossession
set things straight one last time

bury your dead


 trespass


tampering with the codes to our existense
the blasphemy will take its toll
with blood on their hands they alter our perception of reality
morticians clad in white seek their prey

compassion is left behind
in their search for a controllable mind

trespassing on sacred realms
sustaining the dying breed

they will eradicate the features of mans weaknesses
delete improve the versions of ourselves
try to cure us from the disease were dethroned and left to bleed
human natures shedding skin

were all just shedding skin

creating but bitter repercussions
were disarmed of all control
with blood on their hands they alter our perception of reality
morticians clad in white seek their prey


 leech


my future is forged with an axe
i set the pace for you to follow
trade my illusions for your rebellion
the shit i serve you just swallow

honed to perfection
now watch me escalate your flawless life

i am sucking you dry just feed me
sucking you dry just live for me

theres no end to the secrets i pour into your
hatepolluted veins
now ill drain the fetus that i grew in you

bred for abuse
now watch me dominate your pathetic life

rep chorus

like a greedy pig i wallow
i realize all truths are lost
easily fooled you all will follow
like a leech ill drain you all

just feed me
youll die for me


 hollow ground


once again ive lost my way
going nowhere fast i dread the return
spend my days in this selfmade cage
where my soul can dwell
and my loneliness is thriven far to well

all and none of the answers ive found
alone i stand on hollow ground

too many years have passed
too much blood has been spilt
i realize its my destiny my will

things arent always what they seem
as the scars on my skin will show
on hollow ground i stand
on hollow ground repent
the sins were mine im gone i know

dazed and weakened by the haze
went nowhere fast i dread the return
ive lost my ways am i losing my mind
maybe then my redemtions there to find


 revelation


as an outlet for oppression
and as a tool for control
icons of a sterile creed have come to rule mans destiny

in the guise of selfmade saviuors
theyve tried to enslave us all
but these holy chains of imprisonment will be shattered
by the death of god

encircled by a deceitful light
you escape the harsh reality
live sheltered from the awful truths
you internalize the lies of a dead revelation

within the iron gates of fate
they send their lambs to certain death
control kill justify
youve internalized their lies of a fake revelation

you buy redemtion they crush your pride
and feed your mind with visions spawned by fools


 the world burns


conjuring up the demons from the fiery pits of hell
slithering serpents of the underworld release their
black worm seed
enthralled by the falling star watch the
daylight fail

impelled by twisted vengeance fortify the armies
of the dead

brooding darkness spreads his wings
the usurper of the throne

the world burns in penal fire
awakening the spirits of the dead
the world turns forged in fire
risingthe souls of the damned

ravished by the malice which exceeds your darkest dreams
embraced by a sulphur sky take leave of your mortal flesh

all life expired
our visions dead
all hope expired
fortify the armies of the dead


 human debris


pray for me pray for my soul beyond redemption
pray for my pisssoaked heart for the hands that
mould my life so shallow

so shallow
painted smiling face
so hollow

self inflicted pain
noisome life come cut me and bleed me dry

rape me rape my mind rape whats left of me
repulsive abuse yet filled with such desire

desire
painted smiling face
such desire

now watch me fall from grace
gagged violated forgotten
now watch me fall from grace
my psyche ripped and torn

infested  my soul burns
abandoned  my mind churns
human debris twitching violently
i carry hate in every vein my psyche ripped and torn


 silencer


painful struggle youre tangled in my web
hogtied and worn like a crown on my head
a notion to move is a motion to burn
dare a spark into flames then roasted theyll learn

you know theres nowhere to escape
its carved in stone i own your fate
mute aggression perpetuatesilencer

a nonbeliever will be pistol whipped
dropped in the hole then endlessly ripped
you better step back you better toe the line
dont twitch or stray dont you fall behind

excessive appetite to capitalize
another set of morals to realize
face down pinned to the ground
its all justified and sound
know your place and bow down
whats good for me is good for you
you better accept the facts as true

gag the suspects who speak their own mind
the truth is what i say and not what you find
with a firingsquads diplomacy
show stateofart insincerity

you know theres nowhere to escape
its carved in stone i own your fate
your dependency i advocate
silencer


 under the surface


desensitized a living scar
the painful darkness shrouds my mind

ive gazed into my deformed self
tormented and set ablaze

under the surface  there are wounds that never heal
under the surface  where the demons take control

so numb and cold a living void
strife fight regain control to end this agony

ive gazed into my deformed self
tormented and set ablaze
cannot ease this pain called living

something inside me has died
i succumb to the pain
fighting this longlost battle
struggling in vain

something within me has died
i succumb to the dark
drain the life blood from my veins
ease this pain called living


 victim iced


save me ive served my time in hell
cleanse me release me from the pain

bludgeoned and battered tears trickle from your mind
gaping wounds from the razorsharp attack

something is pulling me down
a final descent

victimized
a trail of crimson from your eyes
eternal scourge
i crucify your hope

violated  struggling in the cold
aggrevated  im the thorn in your side

something is pulling me down
too late to repent

victimized
a trail of crimson from your eyes
eternal scourge
i crucify your hope
victim iced
a trail of crimson from your eyes
a simple murder wont satisfy my taste for death

surge of hatred you drown in the darkness of my eyes

 bloodletting


the streets of broken dreams await
the darkness to bring new souls
along for the ride another statistic
on the sidewalk found his peace at
last in your stare lost innocence
seen all the misery of this world
lonely ghosts escaping a dismal
past
another statistic on the sidewalk
found this peace at last

its my final bloodletting
in your stare lost innocence seen
all the misery of this world the
hangmans laughter echoes in the
alleys of the dead
put an end to the manic frustration
find my peace at last put an end to

 edge of madness


i realized i never should be born
in this world where money talks
the honesty of systems can be won
when the power of dollar is running the life

were closing our eyes
how could we be so blind
that we cant see whats going on

the worlds on edge of madness
its burning out with frustration
were never satisfied its never enough
we cant get enough

trying hard to make an extra buck
to roll ourselves in luxury
we get our bottoms overload
so we grab whatever we can take
blinded by the dollar sign
a disease that burns through our minds

the worlds on edge of madness
its burning out with frustration
were never satisfied its never enough
we cant get enough

we are the world on edge of madness
its burning out with frustration
were never satisfied its never enough
we cant get enough
its never enough

i realized i never should be born
in this world where money talks
the honesty of systems can be won

the worlds on edge of madness
its burning out with frustration
were never satisfied its never enough
we cant get enough

we are the world on edge of madness
its burning out with frustration
were never satisfied its never enough
we cant get enough
its never enough

 another dead end for another dead man


cant you see the devil
they curse away your life
what were your impressions
they will blow your mind

its time to cleave up your worst enemy
and see how bad they bleed
trapped in your own cage
sliced from humanity

how does it feel
to be locked up in your own free world
trapped in the shell
another dead end for another dead man

four walls are closing in
youre screaming but you cant be heard
you better believe it
another dead end for another dead man

oh strike back with your anger

youll face against the wall
just another day
been watching over you
what you wanted to see

you stole the years
but you cant feel the difference
your futures assigned
youre now part of the system

how does it feel
to be locked up in your own free world
trapped in the shell
another dead end for another dead man

four walls are closing in
youre screaming but you cant be heard
you better believe it
another dead end for another dead man

use your anger
reap revenge
use your anger
dont turn away


 seeds of the chosen one


seeds of the chosen one
inject the holy whore
to make the ultimate child
laboratory rat that fucked with mother nature
its like a russian roulette

this time i know we went too far  playing god
it will hit back on us all
is this how itll end you can count me out
it will never last  a lethal game

were on our way to see the ending
were on our way to get erased
time is tickin  mother earths twisted
and well all loose control

scientific murder
i knew id begone
you and i are not included
step aside  move away
ill move alone

now i know we went too far  playing god
time is up for the human race
weve passed the point of no return
were already out of the game
you and i
we will never last  a lethal game

were on our way to see the ending
were on our way to get erased
time is tickin  mother earths twisted
and well all loose control


 all turns black


verse 
ive been searching for the peace in my mind
its nowhere to be found
your soul with me
resting under my skin

i see no point of living the life i lead
it hurts me too much
can you feel what i feel

it must go deep
my own soul is my enemy

chorus
it seems like everything i do just crashes down
it leaves an open scar that i know will never heal
broken promises now run through my head
i cant see the future and it all turns black

verse 
whats the point of being here
when this whole life is dragging me down
is this how well be
i dont want to be part of it

it must go deep
my own soul is my enemy

chorus
it seems like everything i do just crashes down
it leaves an open scar that i know will never heal
broken promises now run through my head
i cant see the future it all turns black

verse 
if theres another way
you can live another day
then youll know just when pressures getting stronger
i can hear voices calling my name
i guess they are over my head

chorus x
it seems like everything i do just crashes down
it leaves an open scar that i know will never heal
broken promises now run through my head

 valley of the damned


the way of life
read between the lies
blind man preach to the deaf
the sacrifice in a holy battle
no one will forget
limping through the ashes of the remains
no soul was saved
the great genocide
our fates are sustained

in the valley of the damned
the battles on
the troops of death
the falling army marches on

hiding from the sun
lurk them into darkness
forbidden to be seen
spirit of the evil gods
triumph army of the ghost

their victory inside
the enemy mutilated
now lays before their feet

in the valley of the damned
the battles on
the troops of death
the falling army marches on

strike down the opponents
with wrath from below
the fallen angels army
will march to the throne
march

in the valley of the damned
the battles on
the troops of death
the falling army marches on


 hang him high


awaiting your sentence
locked up in your hell
your crime will now be tested
by the jury representing death
bitterness inside you
all you feel is hate
not for the vicious crime
but for the victims you kept alive

incision precision remove the limps
the pulse beats on the body wont turn cold
i stab i drill my intentions clear
my hands they squeeze but the bastard wont die

hang him high
no remorse for the crimes youve done
hang him high
blood on your hands wont wash away

waiting on deathrow
staring at the walls
the cell is closing up on me
memories i cant defeat

i stab i drill my intentions clear
my hands they squeeze but the bastard wont die

hang him high
no remorse for the crimes youve done
hang him high
blood on your hands wont wash away

a scarred and abused soul
tries to cope with life
hiding in your twisted game
he was dead before he started to feel alive
now justice will take its toll

hang him high
no remorse for the crimes youve done
hang him high
blood on your hands wont wash away


 solar empire


symbols and signs painted everywhere
predynamic hieroglyphs
a path a stargate
armageddon awaits on the other side
storms of hate will plow over the earth

science working to crack the code
bury the gateway let it go
dont let them through
can not gamble with the human race

solar  empire
resurrection of the atomic god
solace  deceiver
searching for another host

through the black holes
travelled for lightyears
looking for another world to reign
rebel attack with intelligent masses
exterminate the enemy with full energy

science working to crack the code
bury the gateway let it go
dont let them through
can not gamble with the human race

solar  empire
resurrection of the atomic god
solace  deceiver
searching for another host

if we can not confirm this
then it doesnt exist
so bury it down again for a thousand years

solar  empire
resurrection of the atomic god
solace  deceiver
searching for another host


 weed out the week


the cryogenic holocaust
slows down the disease
give us all a taste of your miracle
were thirsty for your medicine
the hate burns in our eyes
its kill or be killed
its in the nature of the human races weak mind
to be exterminated by ourselves

just stab their hearts for nothing
your greedy souls scream in envy
kill them all
release the anger
weed out the weak
you dont need them

weed out the weak

exterminate the riff raff
no one will miss you anyway
clean up the world with an iron fist
start the harvest of the dead
theres no room for the weakend mind
theres no room for you
there is a new religion coming around the bend
and its called fuck you

just stab their hearts for nothing
your greedy souls scream in envy
kill them all
release the anger
weed out the weak
you dont need them

weed out the weak
stab them all


 no tomorrow


bright lights
is there anybody out there
from the sky somethings coming my way
it knocked me down im paralyzed except my mind
something else is in control of me

strapped down to a bench i lie
performing surgery im open wide
my life just got simplified
i cant believe im gonna die

dwelling in the unknown
i wont see tomorrow
theyre stealing my life
theyre drilling into my soul
i cant see tomorrow
i am out of time

dwelling in the unknown
i wont see tomorrow
theyre stealing my life
theyre drilling into my soul
i cant see tomorrow
i am out of time

they keep me alive so they can test my strength
pumping my body dry
i cannot feel anything anymore
i guess this is my goodbye

strapped down to a bench i lie
performing surgery im open wide
my life just got simplified
i cant believe im gonna die

dwelling in the unknown
i wont see tomorrow
theyre stealing my life
theyre drilling into my soul
i cant see tomorrow
i am out of time
there is no tomorrow
theyre stealing my life


 global domination


the colonisation of a new species
infecting you and me
the virus has mutated
into an extraterrestrial biological entity

the blessed ones will be genetic hybrids
the survival is the ultimate ideology
we got to fight the future

the geometry of mass infection  global domination
presented to an extended holocaust

it has started
the global domination
mass infection

waiting to be reconstituted
and colonized by an alien race
and unvolved pathogen
the mass infection will make us a slave race

the blessed ones will be genetic hybrids
the survival is the ultimate ideology

 taste the extreme divinity


treasure hunts in suicide land
the hurting never stops
its time to meet your enemy
bleeding games with buried anger
it will be too late
when youre done youll plead insanity

drown them in the dirt
energize the will to kill
never say a word
strike them where it hurts
torture with all you got
a taste of extreme divinity

stealthy shadows of the mad
lionize his victory
legacy of a sick twisted man has been born
razor sharp brain with desire
desire for the kick
the kick to kill

drown them in the dirt
energize the will to kill
never say a word
strike them where it hurts
torture with all you got
a taste of extreme divinity

psycho dances with a knife
he comes for your flesh
knock you down tie you up
feel the blade break your skin


 alive


you call yourself a god
i call you a liar
ill take your crucifix and stab it straight through your heart
reclaim my past dont need no sympathy
i only wanna be me and not live in your religious fantasy world

brainwash the weak
steal all you can steal
defenseless minds of the dumber kind
the church is working overtime

the book of lies becomes alive again
translated twisted read between the lines
the ancient book is still alive
and now they can not tell the truth from lies
they convince you that youre nothing
and nothing but dirt
if you dont contribute
youre no son of god
donate your life and money that you earn
if you wanna see the light you got to sacrifice

brainwash the weak
steal all you can steal
defenseless minds of the dumber kind
god is working overtime

the book of lies becomes alive again
translated twisted read between the lines
the ancient book is still alive
and now they can not tell the truth from lies

dont wanna live in sin
they will make you learn
if youre gonna sin
then youre gonna burn

the book of lies becomes alive again
translated twisted read between the lines
the ancient book is still alive
and now they can not tell the truth from lies


 the quest


ones loss is anothers pain
when someone falls then the others gain

misjudged and stripped down to the bones
the industry is getting rich on the poor
theyll make you bleed out your anger
no one will ask you for your forgiveness

the quest for the sign
will stop at nothing
follows the book of lies
your god told you to look for the sign
suck em all dry like a parasite

kill a million people
and kill another million more
they dont believe in what you believe
its not your gods call

misjudged and stripped down to the bones
the industry is getting rich on the poor
theyll make you bleed out your anger
no one will ask you for your forgiveness

the quest for the sign
will stop at nothing
follows the book of lies
your god told you to look for the sign
suck em all dry like a parasite


 tamed filled with fear


everything is build on conspiracy
nothing has been changed
we just smile accept everything
why do we turn our backs and walk away

its hard to tell right from wrong
its all a conspiracy
like blindfolded cattles
and lead us on til the end

we all are living in a twisted society
nothings gonna stop them
when the truth wont set us free

tamed
filled with fear


 sky is falling down


sky is falling down
sophistic energy
a crack in the core
a burning sodomy for liberty
feel the neon dots thats tattooed in your flesh
cause they dont want you to think in any different way
psychotic preferences
a state of reinvent
and now the new world has just begun
scream all you want
while they drill the holes
lobotomy will set you free

cyanide sacrifice
laser beam sanctuary
transit life suicide
bad dreams do come true

skys falling down
pull the plug
terminate innocent tranquilized
cannot wake up

back in the womb
waiting for the rebirth
tube stuck in your veins
monitored by machines

back in the womb
waiting for the rebirth
tube stuck in your veins
monitored by machines
electric pulses feeding your brain

skys falling down
pull the plug
terminate innocent tranquilized
cannot wake up
skys falling down
take me home


 the sinner


digipak bonus song

raped by the retribution
a failing justice at its costs
demanding true redemption
and regain what youve lost

in the shadows of the weakend kind
lurking for its prey
shapeless worthless gutless souls
from behind the desk theyll make you the

sinner  theyll send you out to the front to be the
sinner  where the bullets reign
sinner  just aim and squeeze the trigger you are the
sinner  you are the scape goat betrayed by your nation

in the name of democracy
rules the country with an iron fist
but the stench from the gutter
says that they are leaders of hypocrisy

shapeless worthless gutless souls
from behind the desk theyll make you the

sinner  theyll send you out to the front to be the
sinner  where the bullets reign
sinner  just aim and squeeze the trigger you are the
sinner  you are the scape goat betrayed by your nation

its brothers in arms
shattered by your feet
sacrificed for democracy
left behind at the enemy line
by the land of the free

we fight
we die

 laid to rest


if there was a single day i could live a single breath i could take
id trade all the others away
the bloods on the wall so youd might as well just admit it
and bleach out the stains commit to forgetting it
youre better off empty and blank than left with a single pathetic trace of this
smother another failure lay this to rest
console yourself youre better alone
destroy yourself see who gives a fuck
absorb yourself youre better alone
destroy yourself
ill chain you to the truth for the truth shall set you free
ill turn the screws of vengeance and bury you with honesty
ill make all your dreams come to life then slay them as quickly as they came
smother another failure lay this to rest
console yourself youre better alone
destroy yourself see who gives a fuck
absorb yourself youre better alone
destroy yourself see who gives a fuck
failure
if there was a day i could live if there was a single breath i could take
id trade all the others away


 hourglass


privileged a chosen few
blessed with our time in hell
witness a divine vision the day we all fell still
rapture of the dying age a shattered hourglass
wrath of the warring gods and so this too shall pass
its only getting worse not worth a moments regret
each dawn another curse every breath a twisting blade
what will be left behind in the ashes of the wake
an ill wind blows this way the edge of the envelope burns
forbearance and my vengeance payment for you intent
fear and death in the wings in thrall of those fallen from grace
petty is as petty does witness the mass disgrace
god forbid you read the signs watch for meanings between the lines
gehenna has now arrived no hindsight for the blind
your trust has been misplaced believed the lies told to your face
became another casualty and now its too late
you finally made it home draped in the flag that you fell for
and so it goes
the a shes of the wake
its only getting worse


 now youve got something to die for


now youve got something to die for
infidel imperial
lust for blood a blind crusade
apocalyptic we count the days
bombs to set the people free blood to feed the dollar tree
flags for coffins on the screen oil for the machine
army of the liberation gunpoint indoctrination
the fires of sedition
fulfill the prophecy
now youve got something to die for
send the children to the fire sons and daughters stack the pyre
stoke the flame of the empire live to lie another day
face of hypocrisy raping democracy
apocalyptic we count the days
well never get out of this hole until weve dug our own grave
and drug the rest down with us the burning home of the brave
burn
now youve got something to die for


 the faded line


witness shames parade the pain of blame repaid
its fucking hopeless
accusations and denial
hopeless demon of another day
colorless stoned solid grey
emptiness of promises i made
so faithless the tenets long betrayed
walk the faded line cursed crawl of time
silence the only promise ever kept
familiar touch a ritual to numb the cut
salvation in vice
anguish is realizing what could have been but never was
its emptiness that fills the cup
devotion in the method of my fall
pointless futility continuing
endless flowing corrupted vein
walk the faded line cursed crawl of time
silence the only promise ever kept
hopeless


 omerta


whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward
whoever cannot take care of themselves without that law is both
for a wounded man shall say to his assailant
if i live i will kill you if i die you are forgiven
such is the rule of honour

broken the paradigm an example must be set
invoke the sirens song and sign the death warrant
this id what has been wrought for  pieces of silver
the tongues of men and angels bought by a beloved betrayer
i am the result whats better left unspoken
violence begins to mend what was broken
youve been talking ive been all ears
words meant to dwell in darkness shall never see the light of day
words can be broken so can bones
execute the mandate
mouth full of dirt
your name is removed from the registry
st peter greets with empty eyes then turns and locks the gate
i am the result whats better left unspoken
violence begins to mend what was broken
youve been talking ive been all ears
omerta
cheaply venal stupidly verbose
a slip of the tongue a slit of the throat
six feet under with no marker
keep my name from your mouth forever
free speech for the living dead men tell no tales
your laughing finger will never point again
omerta
sing for me now


 blood of the scribe


all of this comes crashing down
cornerstones gone
sleepless
hopeless
no end in sight
ink well has run dry fill it with blood of the scribe
rest comes easy to the guiltless
the vampire laments as he prays for the sun
doom despair tragedy are the tools of the trade
cut to the bone rob the grave
unearth the stone lay to waste
defile the tome rip the page
strip mine the vein lay to waste
frayed at the edge flat lined
the anvil cracks
the hammer relentlessly comes down
a new pariah is born
chastisement lays you down to sleep tucks you in with bloody kisses
gifts of nightmares bitter sweet
type a negative shuts me down
catch phrase will be the death of me
this is not what you came to see
what are you not entertained
climb the walls til nails bleed
rip the hair tear the seams break the glass
head in hands bell tolls endlessly
no end in sight


 one gun


the sins of deliverance

the eyes of the patriot fixed through the scope
the unknowing tyrant walks to the rope

its where murder is justice that martyrs are made
a one gun salute for the new independence day
theyll hallow your name
theyll hallow your name for your sacrifice

the sins of deliverance
so let the wicked perish in the presence of god
for your sacrifice

the sins of the father atoned by the son
confessions of commitments broken
a nail driven for every one of them

its where murder is justice that martyrs are made
a one gun salute for the new independence day
theyll hallow your name
theyll hallow your name for your sacrifice

you are the cause i am the effect
created in hatred a noose for your neck

the eyes of the patriot fixed through the scope
the unknowing tyrant walks to the rope
theyll hallow your name
for your sacrifice
theyll hallow your name
sacrifice
sacrifice
sacrifice
theyll hallow your name


 break you


endless mornings cut by the dawn razor
whipping the nightmares to a froth
endless questions with no answers
no replacement for whats been lost
lost
everything suffocates in the dust of the past fortunes squandered
the empire of lies to whom you pandered
suffer a selfimposed exile taste the bitter fruits of denial
in the presence of greatness the humble can only bow
frost on the breath of life
empty of warmth or light
full of nothing but deprivation
eternal winter
tell me a lie with the best of intentions
mute in the age of mass communication
dark days lead to darker nights
frozen out of time
it dies for blessed ego the once mighty laid low
frost on the breath of life
empty of warmth or light
full of nothing but deprivation
you taught hate ill teach you fear
open the eyes kill despair
you cannot squeeze the life from me
son of a bitch im going to rape you
son of a bitch im going to break you


 what ive become


blank stares from broken men
so withered from the poisons they cant remember when
there were once honest reasons
its all a lie it died  miles ago
pretending im still here
justify what ive become sanctify what ive become
amazing disgrace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
better lost if this is found best blinded never to see
the race to save face nothing now is what we meant it to be
pretending im still here
its a system now intertwined
take your place in the line to be ground by the gears of the masterpiece
betrayal
suffered consequence
its been so long since any piece of this made any kind of sense
you anoint the king ill burn everything down to ashes
you giveth i taketh away
its a system now intertwined
take your place in the line to be ground by the gears of the masterpiece
betrayal


 ashes of the wake


we killed a lot of innocent civilians
to us every civilian in baghdad was a terrorist
these fedayeen are now in civilian clothes that makes everybody free game
but if they came in our perimeter we lit em up
and when we would pull the body out and when we would search the car we would find nothing
this took place time and time again no harm no foul thats ok dont worry about it
because this is a new type of war this is an eradication

i honestly feel were committing genocide over here
i dont believe in killing civilians and im not going to kill civilians for the united states marine corp

quoted as a marine in song


 remorse is for the dead


the dirty lord of the manor surveys his filthy domain
too many nights raising hell worked a little all too well
constructed a monument to denial and excess
sunk so low crawled so far back theres nowhere left to regress
if these walls could talk they would tell a horror story
neverending winter violence and infidelity
shadows fall through broken panes
careless words that are filled with hate
just enough to keep it together never enough to make it work
all the tongues here are forked
we are a hailstorm of broken glass follow the path of least expectancy
a huge stinking pile of sick pile it higher and higher
light the match start the fire
level this place until nothing is left and take us with it
surroundings are irate
crack of dawn brings naught but pain
resentment steadily grows
laughing in the gallows
full throttle determined to fail pedal to the metal asleep at the wheel
we are the lucky ones welcome home
poisoned nerves and a bloody antidote
violence is not an aberration its a rule
dying beyond the pale
your beatings will continue until my morale improves
i dont hate you im just removing an enemy
remorse is for the dead my enemy
remorse is for the dead


 another nail for your coffin


japanese bonus track

at a loss for something different to say
ive said everything weve said it all before
an extra nail for your coffin
im going to ride that horse weve beaten to death
and deliver its stinking carcass to your doorstep
a gift from all the dead children
that are the progeny of your ballistic union
borrowing from peter to rape paul
no news is good news but ive got some news for you
fetch me a rope lynch mob of one
an extra nail for your coffin
certain blood has been shed for uncertain reasons
you will never quiet this storm
a cold wind to chill your bones
i bring the hammer down
borrowing from peter to rape paul
no news is good news but ive got some news for you
fetch me a rope lynch mob of one

 walk with me in hell


pray for blood
pray for the cleansing
pray for the flood
pray for the end of this nightmare
this lie of a life can as quickly as it came dissolve
we seek only reprieve and welcome the darkness
the myth of a meaning so lost and forgotten forgotten

take hold of my hand
for you are no longer alone
walk with me in hell

pray for solace
pray for resolve
pray for a savior
pray for deliverance some kind of purpose
a glimpse of a light in this void of existence

now witness the end of an age
hope dies in hands of believers
who seek the truth in the liars eye

take hold of my hand
for you are no longer alone
walk with me in hell

walk with me in hell x

take hold of my hand
for you are no longer alone
walk with me in hell x
youre never alone x
walk with me in hell


 again we rise


storebought attitude and spit
a sugarcoated piece of shit
an instant rebel just add greed
another useless commodity
broken glass and a broken jaw
lies are told in a southern drawl
poorhouse povertys your schtick
the real thing would kill you quick

rise again we will rise
rise again we will rise

blood and fire used to fill the night
burnt and drowned by our very lives
you missed a sinking boat by years
dollar signs crocodile tears
its over now and long has been
those days are gone wont come again
another name crossed off the list
the real thing would kill you quick

rise again we will rise
rise again we will rise

theres nothing for you to fight against
youre so unreal its evident
youll never be one of our kind
this aint yours fuck you dont try

this aint yours fuck you dont try x

this bridge was burnt before you could cross
you reap the benefits of whats lost
go home son hang your costume up
a goddamn insult to the rest of us
a thousandyard stare across the south
a fully belly and a lying mouth
mammas boy plays heretic
the real thing would kill you quick

rise again we will rise
rise again we will rise

x
fuck you dont even try
fuck you your time is nigh
fuck you ive had enough
fuck you your time is up


 redneck


so goddamn easy to write this
you make it spill on the page
so drunk on yourself selfrighteous
a laughing stock of your own fucking stage

but i aint one to call names
or throw stones in a house of glass
you try me

this is a motherfucking invitation
the only one you could ever need
this is a motherfucking invitation
you try me

just one time you got a reason
heard you had nothing to lose
a blind preacher for the pineyed congregation
it must be easy to lose

but i aint one to call names
or throw stones in a house of glass
you try me

this is a motherfucking invitation
the only one you could ever need
this is a motherfucking invitation
you try me

you can tell the same lie a thousand times
but it never gets any more true
so close your eyes once more and once more believe
that they all still believe in you

just one time

this is a motherfucking invitation
the only one you could ever need
this is a motherfucking invitation

just one time

this is a motherfucking invitation
you try me

just one time
you try me
just one time
you try me

you try me


 pathetic


somewhere between an excuse and a lie
you found something that you believe
so proud i guess i cant imagine why
three cheers for what we used to be

pathetic wasted soulless compromised

sleepwalking the mind field
shit talking it crumbles around you
it comes back around

somewhere between delusion and denial
youll drown in your own sympathy
profound at least you thought so at the time
a ghost of who you used to be

pathetic wasted soulless compromised x

 foot to the throat


virginia death threat virginia creeper vine
the hands that feed intent choke the purpose of this time
take all that you can give and i will make it mine
no care for what youve spent even fools gold has its shine

never held down never restrained
virtues foot to the throat free of broken chains
thus always to tyrants
laugh at the conquered the victims now betray

and in this commonwealth
theres merely a common concern for self
we hold these lies to be selfevident
as the dividends will reflect
and in this commonwealth
theres merely a common concern for self
the coffers have long run dry

never held down never restrained
virtues foot to the throat free of broken chains
thus always to tyrants

like a bull in a china shop
but the shelves have all been cleared
a thief in an empty vault
the sheep already sheared

a screen door on a submarine
an eagle with a broken wing
hope in a dead mans dream
the sound of a bell that will never ring

youre just wasting time x


 descending


the river im bound to be found in
a rope chosen bound for the hang
when im blind and i think i see everything
convincing myself again

this god that i worship a faded reflection
this demon i blame a flickering flame
conspire as one exactly the same
its exactly the same

descending
to never recover the pieces to all that weve lost
recover the pieces lost
the pieces to all weve lost

i shudder to think of the consequence
its blasphemy simple and true
the tragic protagonist torments
convincing myself again

this god that i worship a faded reflection
this demon i blame a flickering flame
conspire as one exactly the same
its exactly the same

descending
to never recover the pieces to all that weve lost

 forgotten lost angels


this is a mean and cold town
i hate this fucking place
watch the rats as they all drown
dying slowly day by day
decrepit and falling down
cesspool of human waste
swallow profit in deep now
in death youll finally know the taste

there are no souls left here to save
forgotten lost angels long disgraced

you fucking hypocrite
but hooks in lips they do not lie
compassion served not on your plate
how many of them have you watched die

i cant sing you a happy song
i cant write you a singalong
the only catchy hook ive got
is the one in my bleeding gut

burn it down
burn it down

there are no souls left here to save
forgotten lost angels long disgraced

dead stares dead eyes
choked hopes and vacant minds
blank words blank lives
the end result of endless lies

theres no angels here
to get lost in the first place
jackhammer a fault line
pray for earthquakes
mulhollands on fire
and my cig started it
 should have burnt this fucker down
were here to finish it

im not impressed by much here
much less what you have to say
dont give a fuck who you know
i just want to leave this hellhole

know that you mean nothing to me
nor the lies that seep from your teeth
wont piss on you if youre on fire
one more selfimportant liar

burn it down
burn it down

there are no souls left here to save
forgotten lost angels long disgraces

burn it burn it
burn it burn it
burn it burn it
burn it down


 requiem


down chemical sacrament
blasphemous prayer
deliver me from this so serene apocalypse

just make me fucking numb
deaf blind and fucking dumb
return to sacred sleep

this could be my requiem
and ill feel no pain
this could be my requiem
but dont bury me too deep

drain infected brine
sickened cesspool shell of mine
strap up the hands of time
and push the soul into the vein

just make me fucking numb
deaf blind and fucking dumb
return to sacred sleep

this could be my requiem
and ill feel no pain
this could be my requiem
but dont bury me too deep

 beating on deaths door


shes a slack one born of greed
speaking endless words long and empty
a beggar who still wants to choose
a dethroned queen still demands her dues
if you want something for nothing you take what you get
a virgin whore in a dirty wedding dress

scream for salvation beating on deaths door
but just be careful what you wish for

theres blood stain on the ceiling
but youre the only duck in the shooting gallery
trying to look out through a brickedin window
your destiny lies in the alley below
trying to see yourself in a shattered mirror
when all else fails she holds you with broken arms
theres poison in her veins but the bitch comes for free
a quick fix for all that you think that you need

scream for salvation beating on deaths door
but just be careful what you wish for
the patron saint of fools answers all your request
shes all yours now so deal with it

theres no shoulder left to cry wolf on
youre tied in knots that cant be undone
no more warnings will fall on deaf ears
you lied too many times now no one cares
no one cares

an empty promise with a heart of tin
her crooked smile beguiles and it draws you within
the hope for something more all that you wish for
a kick to the head and a boot to the door
chasing a dragon in a ladies clothes
a paper trail ends in choking smoke
but you know that you lit the match yourself
play the burning cards that you dealt

scream for salvation beating on deaths door
but just be careful what you wish for
the patron saint of fools answers all your request
shes all yours now so deal with it

 in your words


a sacred cash cow with sickly tits
dripping temptation for hypocrites
to death shes beaten
the prosperous endlessly stating the obvious

caught in your words sever the knot this time
somebody show me their true face
face me once as i leave all that i despise
face me as i unleash this hate refined

indict the blameless
transparent designs
pathetic and shameless
crucified
a legend in his own mind enthroned by lies
a cheap machiavelli plots his demise

caught in your words sever the knot this time
somebody show me their true face
face me once as i leave all that i despise
face me as i unleash this hate refined
face me as i leave all this far behind
face me as i unleash this hate refined

what once gave life
now infested with plague
the lamb lies with maggots
blinded gagged betrayed

what once gave life
now infested with plague
the lamb lies with maggots
the corpse bloated with rage


 set to fail


you want to blame me for the way you hate yourself
you think you can find who you are in someone else
criticize to better your relative positioning
youve got a long way to go

so go and weave your tale of woe
convincing yourself its so
youre so set to fail

somewhere youve finally lost your way
only yourself left to betray

a nameless heir apparent paranoid despair
you take great measure to appear like you dont care
precision and persuasion must precede the proper lie
youve lost it before you began

so go and weave your tale of woe
convincing yourself its so
youre so set to fail

somewhere youve finally lost your way
only yourself left to betray

feeding blood junkie habits of the elephant man
quench his thirst with black water rising
executive outcomes on a burning horizon

and plant the lynching trees

running red lights in a green zone

hidden aegis nothing here to see

and lets snort the bottom line

black liquid assets fuck the mujaheddin
paint their picket fences red with the american dream
lay the hammer hammer down get the job done right
jacked up and clocked in into a fire fight
covert reactions and you never saw me
a glass parking lot in the american dream

 fake messiah


everything youve ever begged me to be
could never have meant any less to me
everything youve ever asked me to say
its so far away from the truth

fake messiah
stitches sown in your eyes
fake messiah
prophecy now denied

over and over and ever again
defending your insignificance
useless intent hidden behind your mask
a cowards voice anonymous
so far away from the truth

fake messiah
stitches sown in your eyes
fake messiah
prophecy now denied
fake messiah
open mouth drawing flies
fake messiah
prophecy now denied

generation failure
suspended in irrelevance
slit you wide open
just to see what youre made of
so far away from the truth

 grace


broken bones and the will
capacity to disappear in misery saves
soaking pain as a thrill hate to instill
compassions a cage

forgiving the father
read the story on my skin
ill be the martyr
falling from his grace again

sunken sooner or later
we crawl our way back into our favorite hole
drunken swallow the savior
and follow him to hang from the highest pole

forgiving the father
read the story on my skin
tell me more about the man i should have been
ill be the martyr
falling from his grace again
this is where the end begins


 broken hands


i can feel your fear and weakness
i see my own in the mirrors of your eyes
carved into a corner hopeless
theres death ahead and doom behind
theres a bad storm blowing in
and most of us wont make it
the wreckage of your past
means nothing now forsake it

the memories cripple you
youre torn apart your doubt must

die
it only fell apart cause you let it
bled of all you had to lose
pick up the pieces with your broken
hands
it only fell apart cause you let it
bled of all you had to lose
pick up the pieces with your broken
hands

well theres those that do
and those that just do talking
were all going through hell
its burn or keep on walking
the blackguards sing their shanty
pure death riding the wind
right now its do or die
now will you choose to live

the memories that ruin you
youre torn apart your doubt must

die
it only fell apart cause you let it
bled of all you had to lose
pick up the pieces with your broken
hands
it only fell apart cause you let it
bled of all you had to lose
pick up the pieces with your broken
hands

you best delay selfpity
locked in devastations throes
the noose waits you swinging
a blade of malice cuts the rope

hostility ensues no attempt to repent
your struggles vindicate the illest of intent

die
it only fell apart cause you let it
bled of all you had to lose
pick up the pieces with your broken
hands
it only fell apart cause you let it
bled of all you had to lose
pick up the pieces with your broken
hands


 dead seeds


and you may tremble before hells gates
you may watch as the heavens fall
and you may slight the hands of fate
you may heed the sirens call

and you may reach every golden shore
witness repent in the heathen
and you may dance in the sands of the war
you may sleep in the cradle of eden

betrayed your prophets
dead seeds buried deep
an army of none
well prey on the weak

and you may walk through the river run dry
you may strike down the giant with stone
and you may never again speak a lie
confess every sin and atone

and you may drink from the infidels blood
as their civilization collapses
you may rejoice in the cleanse of the flood
and stare into the face of apocalypse

betrayed your prophets
dead seeds buried deep
an army of none
well prey on the weak

you will not comprehend
or find words that will describe
the will of god and man
until you watch someone die

betrayed your prophets
dead seeds buried deep
an army of none
well prey on the weak


 everything to nothing


then you wake
another body bag pathetic
picture frame obituary faded in the attic
a shadow of someone you used to be
youve seen so many in these flames
and swore that youd never become the cliche
a long forgotten memory
and when you wake

everything you ever wanted
everything you never had
everything learned forgotten and dead
everything turns to nothing

another day a little dirt for the grave
is it worth everything that you gave
what a beautiful way to waste away
consumed by dependency
a lesson in despondency
a long forgotten memory
and when you wake

everything you ever wanted
everything you never had
everything learned forgotten and dead
everything turns to nothing

and when you wake
how quickly the master
turns into the slave
slowly succumbing more
every dying day

everything you ever wanted
everything you never had
everything learned forgotten and dead
everything turns to nothing


 choke sermon


sermon sung me slow to sleep
faster if i had a choice
with every breath another death
still so in love with your own voice
idle threats to hide regrets
excuses serve to bide the time
cover tracks double back
we summon silence so divine

greeted with a thundering
absence of applause

choke on your own words
lies are venom in your veins
burn from the inside
and never speak my name

jesus complex gag reflex
trigger happy redundancy
no thrill no chase no saving grace
hypnotic in monotony

loaded with a salt rock shot
you say youre everything youre not
what might have been is all youve got
from here and now youre dead to me

greeted with a thunderous
absence of applause

choke on your own words
lies are venom in your veins
burn from the inside
and never speak my name

nothing will ever erase
or undo your disgrace
a lonely selfembrace
theyve long forgotten you
still cling to what it was
a lost and hopeless cause
forever mourning your loss
theyve long forgotten you

murdered slowly in minute
increments of time
pissing up a rope
another moment passes by

choke on your own words
lies are venom in your veins
burn from the inside
and never speak my name


 reclamation


humanitys a failed experiment
walking the path to extinction
spinning its wheels endlessly
grease them with oil and uranium
the earth will shake
and the waters will rise
the elements reclaim what was taken

the skyline is set ablaze with regret
ashes cover a falling silhouette
the city will reap what its sewn and ignite
watching as the city burns tonight

blindly consuming mass manufactured faith
mankind is a festering parasite
relentlessly draining its host dry
nailing belief to a cross of genocide
the elements reclaim what was taken

the skyline is set ablaze with regret
ashes cover a falling silhouette
the city will reap what its sewn and ignite
watching as the city burns tonight

only after the last trees cut
and the last river poisoned
only after the last fish is caught
will you find that money cannot be eaten

and everything becomes irrelevant
as the sky tears open
fire rains down
the fourth world comes to an end
push the button light the match
feel the fault lines detach
crosshairs in the evening light
i sit and watch the city burn tonight

the city burns tonight


 we die alone


digipack bonus

verse 
a moment in time worthy only of solitude
a stranger not meant for another to see

are we the abandoned
are we the deserter
lived in the night so his wickedness way

the faces light up their screens
as the wealthy cash in on the war
the body counts rise the ratings will soar

another deceiver
the liar the patriot
counting the lies and keeping the score
the score

prechorus
look at the light based on faith that deserts you
you are the hunted the victim the prey and the fallen

chorus
we die alone

verse 
a lamb in the line has been lead to the slaughter
another to join all the ghosts from before
join all the ghosts from before

another believer another casualty
cant tell the way out from a drain to the floor
the floor

prechorus

chorus


 shoulder of your god


digipack bonus

death lies eternal
a heathen rapture consumes the light
impaled on its axis
the world around me lays down to die

immaculate contraception
the massive beating opiate
apocalyptic conception
planted its seething reprobates

unremitting desolation
there is no reprieve
the end goes

the angels eyes are gouged with tragedy
the end goes
the fallen host endure mortality
the end goes

a black pasteur
devoid of the shepherd
where you choose to dwell

venomous concepts
catalyst of damnation
unease filtered through chemical haze
youre so far gone

sole purveyor of your own unrest
go cry on the shoulder of your god
youre so far gone
the catalyst of damnation

a lone voice in the void
there is no reprieve
the end goes

no answer will be found to the endless why
the end goes
deeds done in darkness will always come to light
the end goes

a black pasteur
devoid of the shepherd
where you choose to dwell

venomous concepts
catalyst of damnation
unease filtered through chemical haze
youre so far gone

sole purveyor of your own unrest
go cry on the shoulder of your god
youre so far gone
the catalyst of damnation

the nephlim walk the earth again
primordial chaos resurrected
the divine narcotic strungout seraphim
the catalyst catalyst of damnation

in the code of life a spiral death a rattle from within
the healing sties no answers lie in a world without end

venomous concepts
catalyst of damnation
unease filtered through chemical haze
youre so far gone

sole purveyor of your own unrest
go cry on the shoulder of your god
youre so far gone
the catalyst of damnation


 condemn the hive


japanese bonus track

soon come a burning
soon come a reaving
spare the rod spoil the child
resume the righteous beating

hubris has been spoonfed to you
on a silver platter
the weak will run weeping
delusion shattered

no one owes you a god damn thing

bloated with pride youre privileged once
a walking portrayal your lifes fucking done
bloated with pride the privileged one
condemn the hive

the wells run dry
narcissist fills it with tears of blood
poison junos choking lapdog deepen the cut

no one cares what the fuck you think

bloated with pride youre privileged once
a walking portrayal your lifes fucking done
bloated with pride the privileged one
condemn the hive

say goodbye worthless beginners
severed all reason in a fractured mirror
solid stares uneven high expectations
a generations entitlement comes undone
your life is fucking done

your pitiful life
condemning the hive
so feeble inside
condemning the hive
condemning the hive

bloated with pride the privileged ones
a walking portrayal your lifes fucking done
bloated with pride the privileged ones
the privileged ones

 black label


the human confrontation ive build a phobia
it takes my essence somewhere
somewhere to take control

i may be far from rocking
i am the one alone
i may be far behind lines
and made them turn away

i want to know hey you watch out
ive made them turn to cripple hey you watch out
when i will know wholl know back fight
why time would let me die to control

i fear nothing why dont you know
i rip my mind and why dont you bleed
i fear no one why you turn back
i may not stop

my freedom cant contain but tell me
the pain i liberate
riff hostility to anyone
has made us so much hate
i made them turn from hate but tell me
the pain and suffering
i made them turn from hate but tell me
the pain and suffering
i know

the official released booklet lyrics

the human condition is inherit claustrophobia
compression of my space made complete
i would rip out my own entrails by hand just to be alone
inanity rolls total through this sphere
ostracized for clarity of vision
a dream unrealized of solitude that i should descend into autonomy
and know the pain of fellowship no more
i feel nothing but a lack of space
paradox of socialization results in duress
rife with hostility what has caused me so much hate
humanity exterminate with extreme prejudice


 a warning


im a monster so dont walk my way
dont trust my smile my teeth are like knives
ill drag you down  suck you dry
dont laugh at my jokes the punchline is murder
dont enjoy my touch every caress hides a chokehold
im only happy when ive ruined everything i see
believe everything youve ever heard about me suck it up
if you see me coming dont stop just turn  walk the other way
i will not lie about what i have done i will not lie about what i will do to you the sweat of my exertion is pure poison im hell


 in the absence of the sacred


violence a natural reaction in a society whose advances are limited to its new technology
different only in the current mode of destructive intent
date has replaced real life in this world no hope for the stop of progress
inevitable biolink implant will replace the feel of human touch
all memory surrogates downloaded bought  sold no true sense of self
impending sensory death looming near
a number this is what youve become
life digitized itemized commodified
ha ha ha this is what you work for


 letter to the unborn


i want some hatred on through
this pain to feel youre fading
they say stop be more gentle
it seems i walk this hard trail alone
come danger take them all
then throw them at the walls
lost
why wont you let me go
what does your father feel
there is no point is your papa not living now
im gonna tear off the legs of the one that killed
me the most powerfull human of all
woe
i a missing father
an empty role
why did this immortal good child forget me
whyd a mans own father blow these
heartstrings away
thrice have i called for blood i want the undead child
why wouldnt fate let this unborn child
die a wooden blow
please
kill
him


 the black dahlia


i am the ones  the zerosthat control commerce  file you silently far away
i am the children starving in the gutter bellies full of unabated poverty
i am nihilism no future base instinct realized environmental collapse
i am life
i am the corpse of decency crucified on a post of greed and moral decay
i am man
submit  surrender unto ceasar what is his rightful due
complete oppression no catharsis in emphatic contempt for all of life
i am man


 terror  hubris in the house of frank pollard


all the fucked up things trap  punish me i cannot explain my problem
kill my hopeless life i cannot be hypnotized you owe me
push aside the veil to welcome in the visitors
eyes like halogen illuminate the soma peering out of spherical night mask
paleolithic subconscious icons lumber through dreamscape archetype of archangel
terror and hubris  infants painted gauze peer through murky jars soon im wearing the skin of the morning star
green locks my name fills an empty banner frank what have you gotten me into now
i am not afraid to speak my heart  mind it cannot be saved sell me over
fuck your hopeless world i am blacker than the sun
tragedy have you seen the speedy yes
bleeds through the sleep onto the page im sailin


 the subtle arts of murder  persuasion


the dark crow man sits and stares into the oblivion into cold into nothingness its snowing in his mind
hes created himself in his own image lust held for him means naught a knock on the door brings no smile to his cruel lips
the welcome in a womans eyes holds nothing for him
alone on his haunches the hair raises on the back of his neck his dead eyes pierce the night
as his gaze falls down on the city it fills him the method ascertained conviction
he knows what to do and moves to commit the deed


 pariah


the sore on the edge of your mouth it mirror the ones on your arm of black tar youve known the ripping
and ive seen you pissing your condition into the dirt
i know you dont want to live in the dirt you want to know nothing but dirt you know you cant beat weakness
kill the flux stretched to breaking an obscene canvas on a stretcher of parasitism
you piece of shit i wont say your name but i will say this  fuck off and die sooner the better
youve shot out your eyes but im seeing that you cannot feel anything of worth
know that youve pissed life away lost in your narcotic dreams
heart pumping futile shit through your veins
why does it bother i want to punch in your sunken face and see your dusty blood smear through the air in a polluted crimson arc
splattering in a useless pattern on the concrete
moribund


 confessional


intrinsic rot traces of future your past will rise haunting you again
tounging the glue stamp seal of your fold
cased in forests of black steel rod
vines of nerve float downstream sections of horror
this is something you must never do again
falling spiral down you know not what you are looking for but it will find you anyway
ive confessed this disease to you handed you a key to control
fuel for your malicious intent
punish me for my failure dissect my faith twisting my trust
never no more im alone


 odhgabfe


hate falling three feet to the ground
face down on the cold floor of a welloiled sf pigsty i met my one true love
feel youth crushed somewhere between concrete  boot another victim of the lower hate
you are not my god you think this is funny dont you pig
how the helpless freak squirms beneath our state sanctioned soles but what is he laughing at
there was nothing padded about a wagon full of mace
rotator cuff hyper extends behind my back ribs cracking beneath a rain of sticks  heels falling down like the rain outside
oh yeah bitch im gonna remember your face your name your number
and when i crawl out of this hole im going to make you all mine

 ruin


the knowledge that seeking the favor of another
means the murder of self
this is the resolution
the end of all progress
the death of evolution
it bleeds all life away
silence speeds the path to the streams of solace that run so few and narrow
brooks that babble the sounds of torture
you will one day rise
to flood the banks of the chosen
this is the art of ruin
this is the resolution
the end of all progress
the death of evolution
it bleeds all life away
i will show you all that i have mastered
fear pain hatred power
this is the art of ruin


 as the palaces burn


the fiends have gagged a generation of pacified fools
bound by our greed a nation enslaved as corporate tools
arise and raze the legacy of their lies
to realize that this in itself is an ascension
towards the day we revolt
as the seeds youve cast away take hold
war will be born
rejoice the age of the fall has begun
well dance as the palaces burn
a shot gun blast into the face of deceit
youll gain your just reward
well not rest until the purge is complete
you will reap what youve sown
my redemption lies in your demise
in such a world as this does one dare to think for himself
the paradox of power and peace will destroy itself
to know the truth and live in fear of no man
to realize that this in itself is an ascension
toward the day we revolt
as the seeds youve cast away take hold
war will be born
rejoice the age of the fall has begun
well dance as the palaces burn
my redemption lies in your demise
rejoice the age of the fall has begun
well dance as the palaces burn


 purified


can the pestilence within you be bled out
may i have the honor of this amputation
know that you have made an enemy
to show you the meaning of indignity
i live now solely for the pleasure of your slow decay
feel the pain of vengeance burn you
soon you shall know silence
with trembling hands youll beg for mercy
ill show you none
purified by my hand
in this my world
it is salvation
your futile existence draws to a close
a cloak of lies drops
the lies drop


 th hour


the hour of reckoning draws near
judgment day is here and gone
sweetly she draws me into her arms
a liquid embrace to chase the day way
sedate numb deaf and dumb
stumbling into solitude
a clouded judgment day is fueled
take me under your black wings
mark my words and remember me
so sweetly she shucks away at my time
so sweetly she draws me nigh
closer and closer towards never ending sleep
spin the bottle
kiss only the bottle
the dark mistress of many beholden to none
slips a ring of needles around your arm in an engagement
eternal engagement
never consummated
take me under your black wings
mark my words and remember me
destroyer of senses
so take as needed for the pain
another gray morning dawns across an ashen sky
my sweet demoness beckons me
ever again and again and again and again
the dark mistress of many beholden to none
my sweet demoness beckons me
ever again and again and again and again and again
take me under your black wings
jacked up on the taste of selfdestruction


 for your malice


welcome home to my reality
so you taste yourself every time
this must be your pleasure
this your swan song ill sing for you
ill cut the words from your mouth
youll never speak my name again
locked up and sold the fuck out
dont think you wont see me again
itll come back three times
once in the name of deceit
twice for your malice
three times when i take you away
this is a homicide daydream
i wont waste my hate on you
all that youve claimed not to be
has now come to define you
itll come back three times
once in the name of regret
twice for your envy
three times when i take you away
turn on my heels
and spit apathy on this bridge you have burnt
feast on my own blood
ill drain myself to sleep
ill rise from death to knife this beast
these last regrets the ones i keep
itll come back three times
once in the name of deceit
twice for your malice
three times when i take you away


 bootscraper


watch the broken common man
drown his sorrows at unhappy hour
dirty and sweaty
with just enough to get by
calluses on his hands calluses on his soul
hardboiled son of a bitch
scraping away on the down hill grind
its a means to an end a mean end for most
death and domestication ends in shattered hopes
cant see the hand at the other end of the leash
turn and bite
turn and bite the hand that bleeds you dry
throw yourself a bone no one else will
compromise leads to selfloathing
money the excrement of labor
and you dont get to keep shit
except politics and power trips and a bad breath down your neck
i know
for i have toiled in the halls of the mighty
and not received a teardrop in a bucket
motherfuck it
the world doesnt owe me a thing
but you do motherfucker
so crooked when you die theyre gonna have to screw your ass into the ground
as life slowly unravels
with nothing to show but wasted time and dust
a thousand points of lies falling on the deafened funeral eardrums of the blind masses
rise above extract your life
will you look within
then turn around and bite
day by day the mask suffocates your life
is this any way to live
no fucking way


 a devil in gods country


down south soldier
third world soldier
my vengeance will be swift and terrible
many will die
i am the distance between two points
forgotten a void
i dig holes brother
well ive got a bone to pick
and a nerve to pluck
a skin to get under
and a home to wreck
ive got ends to meet
so ive got a job to do

x
acrimonious and sanctified
call me what you will

stick to your guns
the difference is mine are loaded
taste the sting of your arrogance
stuck in this screeching bitch called life
drop the coins and send you to charon
i will have my vengeance
in this life or the next
well ive got a sucker to punch
and a back to stab
a head to kick in
and a throat to slit

x
ive got a job to do
harsh and unrepentant

x
acrimonious and sanctified
call me what you will

step back before youre the next to get served
with some southern hospitality


 in defense of our good name


returning to solace
so sweet like honeysuckle on the tongue
the sound of silence blesses my ears
enveloping like the earth i will one day lie in
metropolis is bad to wither the soul
roaring concrete and steel washes you in blood
so let you point and laugh
provincial aint so bad
take me back down to where i belong
to rust in rivers
i do not covet any mans life
i know my place all too well
one mans paradise is another mans living hell
to each their own
generations ago made this place my own
the roots are deep and strong
carry them wherever i go

never wanted your approval
never wanted your acceptance
never wanted to be anything but me
never wanted to be anywhere but here
carry me southeast bound home

to speak in defense of our good name
lay me to rest with my kin
in the ground of gods country

lash out at any who would smear you with hate
deify no one never crawl ashamed
the past screams injustice on southern night wind
whips manacles chains musket balls
a dark history never forgotten
only misconception remains

speak in defense of our good name
the blood of kin grants absolution
ill join them soon enough in the ground of gods country

never wanted your acceptance
never wanted your approval
never wanted to be anything but me
never wanted to be anywhere but right here


 blood junkie


a shallow little jackal of a man posing as a hawk
conniving opportunist
lease the blade the gun the bomb in the name of justice
a violent panacea for what ails the nation
in advancement for the pig
youll not wrest the truth from my hands
eyes never closed clarity
clamped down in a grip so tight on ordinary horror
peering through a curtain of blood
retribution or vengeance it matters not which
as long as the pig stays on top of the ladder of bone his father has built
ashes to ashes to the dust
eaten spiced with ambivalence
the nation swallows it all whole
weakened by their collective neck in the noose
commerce brings war
jihad has come to both sides
eye for an eye fire for fire
raining death as the towers crumble
this will never end
left without a choice
by the fiscal elite
war is set in motion by higher powers
a pissing contest for the unknown
left bankrupt we all die inside
as a couple jumps hand in hand to their death
wrapped in swaddling lies and laid in a dumpster
spoon fed shit doesnt even turn their stomachs
gaping mouths yawn for more abuse
someone needs to tip the nest
the pig ascends
as i sink deeper
seething misanthropic
waiting for my death


 vigil


our father thy will be done
i have denied this life its worth
i will not be the victim
sickness to you my master
heres to getting worse
hope it kills you faster
show me how it hurts to rot from the inside out
this vigil burns
until the day our fires overtake you
our father we forsake you
blessed be his name
nothing now the same
ask me why i hate
why ive prayed to see the nation that i loved disintegrate
and gladly give my life
that revolution regenerates
in honor of the strife of those whove died
in generations before for your blood stained glory
i reject you
i deny you
i defy you to continue
smite the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered

 cowboys from hell


under the lights where we stand tall
nobody touches us at all
showdown shootout spread fear within without
were gonna take whats ours to have
spread the word throughout the land
they say the bad guys wear black
were tagged and cant turn back

you see us comin
and you all together run for cover
were taking over this town

here we come reach for your gun
and you better listen well my friend you see
its a pistol is down below aimed at you
were the cowboys from hell

aimed at you were the cowboys from hell
deed is done again weve won
aint talking no tall tales friend
cause high noon your doom
comin for you were the cowboys from hell

pillage the village trash the scene
but better not take it out on me
cause a ghost town is found
where your city used to be
so out of the darkness and into the light
sparks fly everywhere in sight
from my double barrel  gauge
cant lock me in your cage

you see us comin
and you all together run for cover
were taking over this town

here we come reach for your gun
and you better listen well my friend you see
its a pistol is down below aimed at you
were the cowboys from hell
deed is done again weve won
aint talking no tall tales friend
cause high noon your doom

 psycho holiday


empty and sweating
head lying in your hands
shaking in the corner
done too much alcohol
gotta get away from it all
cause it feels my blood is freezing
my self insanity has taken its toll
frustration has taken its control

now im far from home
spending time alone
its time to set my demons free
been put to the test
my mind laid to rest
im on a psycho holiday

shot down on sight
you are the target of attention
one woman here another there
you cant please all the people all the time
cant tell the strangers
from the friends you know
frustration has taken its control

now youre far from home
spending time alone
its time to set your demons free
been put through the test
your mind laid to rest
youre on a psycho holiday

im strapped in for life
is this where i lived
or where i died
you want my money
you take my space
my mind is telling me
to leave this place
my self insanity has taken its toll
frustration has taken its control

now youre far from home
spending time alone
its time to set your demons free
been put through the test
your mind laid to rest
youre on a psycho holiday


 heresy


here we are
in a world of corruption
human nature is
of violent breed
who cares if theres no tomorrow
when i die for my futures
laid out for me
cant you see
rise above the lies
morals on a backwards globe
a sin to you
for me its hope

its my life and provision
black or white
some pay to pray
you question why they
act this way
its their fucking decision

no more judgement day
only tranquility
peace signs protest lines
mean nothing to me

honesty born in me
heresy

i know whats right or wrong
and my belief is stronger
than your advice
people they go to war
because religion gives them
reason to fight
sacrifice die for pride
a group that caters
no ones fees
or synthetic deities
is where i belong
my stand is the human race
without a label or a face
so they can lick my sack

no more judgement day
only tranquility
peace signs protest lines
mean nothing to me

honesty born in me
heresy


 cemetery gates


reverend reverend is this some conspiracy
crucified for no sins
an image beneath me
whats within our plans for life
it all seems so unreal
im a man cut in half in this world
left in my misery

the reverend he turned to me
without a tear in his eyes
its nothing new for him to see
i didnt ask him why
i will remember
the love our souls had
sworn to make
now i watch the falling rain
all my mind can see
now is your face

well i guess
you took my youth
i gave it all away
like the birth of a
newfound joy
this love would end in rage
and when she died
i couldnt cry
the pride within my soul
you left me incomplete
all alone as the
memories now unfold

believe the word
i will unlock my door
and pass the
cemetery gates

sometimes when im alone
i wonder aloud
if youre watching over me
some place far abound
i must reverse my life
i cant live in the past
then set my soul free
belong to me at last

through all those
complex years
i thought i was alone
i didnt care to look around
and make this world my own
and when she died
i shouldve cried and spared myself some pain
left me incomplete
all alone as the memories still remain

the way we were
the chance to save my soul
and my concern is now in vain
believe the word
i will unlock my door
and pass the cemetery gates


 domination


agony is the price
that youll pay in the end
domination consumes you
then calls you a friend
its a twisted fall
binds are like steel
and manipulates the will to be
and its hard to see
how soon we forget
when theres nothing else
left to destroy
its a useless ploy

your eyes will see
the dawn of the day
and the writing
on the wall
those words that stare
into your soul
and to yourself
you will befall

its domination pushed into living hell
domination a now blacked heart
is reaching out divinity
body suspended by chains over razors
and nails its a penalty
each razor a vice and each nail
marks the demise of your life
grim construction grows
has life played a trick
sealed you in brick by brick
til your end forcing you to bend

your eyes will see

 shattered


its storming broken glass corpses left in piles
ungracious bludgeonmnet that breaks the earth for miles
nothing can stop it the day has come from below its catastrophic

freezing theres no healing families are dying

this world is shattered all shattered

life crushing turbulence this wrath cant be denied
wishing you could help your friends standing where they died
echoes haunting a hollow planet lacerations dissected nation

freezing theres no healing everyone is dying

this world is shattered all shattered


 clash with reality


sometimes i know
i feel untouchable
drowning in life
caught up in the accessible
back down the ground
i hear the sound
theres no escape
the concrete cloud
spilling on me
drenching me with
laymens sins
i hear the sirens
from the back of me
im crashing face first
into the glass eye

clash with reality
it rears its ugly head
clash with reality
the indescribable
let the dogs lie
where we sleep
irrelevant theme

a situation and theres
nothing but right
in kicks the door
nobody moves
cause in walks the problem
dictates your fate
evicts convicts
wholl sign the writ of life
this now becomes
their morbid game
whos piss poor excuse
is this for a world
it swells my hatred
day by day

clash with reality
it rears its ugly head
clash with reality
the indescribable
let the dogs lie
where we sleep
irrelevant theme


 medicine man


many distant miles away
past the shores of ever dark
there stays a magic man
who bears an evil mark
he helps all concerned
those who come again return
injecting lies while fires burn
the devils heart
with angels words
have you wondered
what heavens like
he can show you in one night
overwhelming with euphoric lift
to lure you to steal your gift

intoxication
seeping down to the bone
and theres no question
where you have to go

understand just take his hand
hes the medicine man

once proud and fearless men
with desire in their eyes
lost strong and fruitful lives
to selfindulgent ties
their souls were dipped in venom
and put into a box
then placed upon a crowded shelf
where countless souls now rot
have you ever wondered what hells like
he can take you there
just one taste and youll be back
and by the high youll swear

intoxication
seeping down to the bone
and theres no question
where you have to go

understand just take his hand
hes the medicine man


 message in blood


theres a place that i keep deep inside me
it can trigger my mind
all along i knew it has been with me
since i was just a child

i just summon power within my soul
it has given me life beyond life i take
blame for my murderous problem my signature
always reminds

its a message in blood
its your cryptic warning
within the message in blood
marks the years of pain
and your godforsaken ending to life

im provoked into sick confrontations brutal
time after time bed of nails suffocation
lifes ending slay in different designs
one mans misery is another mans mystery
no one cares to understand my
demented means
sticks and stones can break all your
brittle bones epitaph written at your feet

its a message in blood
its your cryptic warning
within the message in blood
marks the years of pain
and your godforsaken ending to life


 the sleep


understanding what has
happened before us
we are confined to a
darkened hidden tomb
the conquering of our world
as we knew it
rise above this pit
of sorrow and pain
among the few
we are the avant leaders
weve got to live
through this trouble and decay

this question haunts my mind
will we survive this night
were harboring the meek
will we survive the sleep

unsure and scared
we are planning our reprise
revolves around this world
we dont know anymore
the odds against us
yet were stronger and prevailing
learn from mistakes
counting souls for sale

this question haunts my mind
will we survive this night
were harboring the meek
will we survive the sleep


 the art of shredding


unity is a rare thing
blind eyes of society bring
the category of minority
now what are we supposed to be
born free to be
powerless to change the world
with our lives in the hands of madmen

now in times when society needs us
this is where the sin begins
were aware theyre going to free us
rage from our hearts within
born of this world
which is a living hell
but well be closer to heaven

so now this is the art
to shred its only emotion

 mouth for war


revenge
im screaming revenge again
wrong
ive been wrong for far too long
been constantly so frustrated
ive moved mountains with less
when i channel my hate to productive
i dont find it hard to impress

pre
bones in traction
hands break to hone raw energy
bold and disastrous
my ears cant hear what you say to me

chorus
hold your mouth for the war
use it for what its for
speak the truth about me
determined

possessed
i feel a conquering will down inside me
strength
the strength of many to crush
who might stop me
my strength is in number
and my soul lies in every one
the releasing of anger can better any medicine under the sun

pre

chorus

there comes a time within everyone to close your eyes to whats real
no comprehension to fail
i vacuum the wind for my sail
cant be the rest
let others waste my time
owning success is the bottom line
like a knife into flesh
after life is to death
pulling and punching the rest of duration
no one can piss on this determination


 a new level


now a new look in my eyes my spirit rise
forget the past
present tense works and lasts
got shit on
pissed on
spit on
stepped on
fucked with
pointed at by lesser men

pre
new life in place of old life
unscarred by trials

chorus
a new level of confidence and power

demanding plea for unity between us all 
united stand
death before divided fall
in mock military order
vulgar
power
impatient
because time is shorter

pre

chorus

no fucking surrender
cant lose
life kills


 walk


cant you see im easily bothered by persistence
one step from lashing out at you
you want in to get under my skin
and call yourself a friend
ive got more friends like you
what do i do

pre
is there no standard anymore
what it takes who i am where ive been belong
you cant be something youre not
be yourself by yourself
stay away from me
a lesson learned in life
known from the dawn of time

chorus
respect walk what did you say
respect walk are you talking to me
are you talking to me

run your mouth when im not around its easy to achieve
you cry to weak friends that sympathize
can you hear the violins playing your song
those same friends tell me your every word

pre

chorus
respect walk what did you say
respect walk are you talking to me
respect walk what did you say
respect walk are you talking to me

 fucking hostile


almost every day
i see the same face
on broken picture tube
it fits the attitude
if you could see yourself
you put you on a shelf
your verbal masturbate
promise to nauseate
today ill play the part of nonparent
not make a hundred rules
for you to know about yourself
not lie and make you believe
whats evil is making love
and making friends
and meeting god youre own way
the right way

chorus
to see
to bleed
cannot be taught
in turn
youre making us
fucking hostile

we stand alone

the truth in right and wrong
the boundaries of the law
you seem to miss the point
arresting for a joint
you seem to wonder why
hundreds of people die
youre writing tickets man
my mom got jumped  they ran
now ill play a public servant
to serve and protect
by the law and the state
id bust the punks
that rape steal and murder
and leave you be
if you crossed me
id shake your hand like a man
not a god

chorus

come meet your maker boy
some things you cant enjoy
because of heavenhell
a fucking wives tale
they put it in your head
then put you in your bed
hes watching say your prayers
cause god is everywhere
now ill play a man learning priesthood
whos about to take the ultimate test in life
id question things because i am human
and call no one my father whos no closer that a stranger

i wont listen

chorus


 this love


if ever words were spoken
painful and untrue
i said i loved but i lied
in my life
all i wanted
was the keeping
of someone like you
as it turns out
deeper within me
love was twisted and pointed at you

never ending pain quickly ending life 

chorus
you keep this love thing love child love toy
you keep this love fist love scar love break
you keep this love

id been the tempting one
stole her from herself
this gift in pain
her pain was life
and sometimes i feel so sorry
i regret this the hurting of you
but you make me so unhappy
id take my life and leave love with you

id kill myself for you id kill you for myself 

chorus

no more head trips


 rise


weve got no time to lose
your news is old news
hate this hate me hate this
right approach for the wrong
its time to spread the word
let the voice be heard
all of us one of us all of us
dominate and take the motherfucking world

mass prediction unification
breathing life into our lungs
every creed and every kind
to give us depth for strength

taught when were young to hate one another
its time to have a new reign of power
make pride universal so no one gives in
turn our backs on those who oppose
then when confronted we ask them the question
whats wrong with their mind
whats wrong with your mind

chorus
its time to rise

weve lived with past mistakes
and weve lived with our own
forgive forget forgive
be a man not a child
there are to tears for peace
of the common sympathies
educate reinstate educate
a thing of past
the trouble in the states

its time to rise


 no good attack the radical


in the states
theres a problem with race
because of ignorant past burned fires
from evolution
weve been killing each other
i figure man should have it down to a science

no chance
not for a minute
not for a second
i wont be defensive
im straight out in my opinion
youd better listen to a man who knows what he is saying
ive seen your side
you run and hide for the mere fact that you feel inferior
be superior
and know your interior

pre
race pride prejudice
black man white man
no stand
live in the past
we make it last
a hated mass
no solution
mind pollution
for revolution

chorus
so low behold my eyes
this land of fools will rise
no good
for no one

you blame oppression and play the role of criminals
to rape and burn show progress is minimal
white hoods and militants you know its such a pity
living breathing
violence in your city

if one man
had one home
in one world
held live alone without variety
full of anxiety
no one to point at question
or even talk to  in his private grave
no matter what color
he wouldnt be saved from hell
he dwells
a closed mind playing the part of prison cells

pre

chorus


 live in a hole


full of grief i scream at the wind
thought i heard the words of others
imprison myself
and stay in a shell
i wont let you in to have a story to tell
things tend to drag me down
dont understand so they hate me now

chorus
my fear grips the will of stone
my grip fears ill die alone

i promised myself somewhere in the teenage life
id never submit to the ones i will not be like
live in a hole
but stay close to my kind
cause they understand what burns in my mind
i still feel incomplete
friends are few and far between

chorus


 regular people conceit


ive trampled on that road
that you think you own
you have that smart ass attitude
its time to stop the fiction

i live it every day
while your minds far away
im out here putting pride on the line
and you case on me with pure respect
one chance at one thing
hard time is coming
my time your pain
i reign on you

pre
you think you own
i take away
take it with me
you think you own
i took away
made it my own

chorus
most regular people would say its hard
and any streetwise son of a bitch knows
dont fuck with this

the so many times
you practice in your mirror
to be just like me
but you just cant see
you aint got the balls son

i fight for love of brother
your friends fight one another
you cant see because your heads up your ass
and just in case you think youre bad
i crush your rush
i rule you fool
im immovable stone in your world of weak  i speak

pre

chorus


 by demons be driven


serving the faith
abduction the oath
it lie in wait for the offering
religion is old
for drawing the young
purity withers and dies
never return to the ones that provided
children draining parents of will
i hold out my hand to bloodless child
im taken by the one i was saving
from death

chorus
by demons be driven
beckon the call

with decline in mind
end not far
were left hanging alone here
he pulls us from nails
shatters our bones
leaving us crippled and strewn
boiling my corpse in the blood of his children
praying for his god to prevail
burying us with loved ones
to sleep with shelled children of the sixth dimension

chorus


 hollow


whats left inside him
dont he remember us
cant he believe me
we seemed like brothers
talked for hours last month
about what we wanna be
i sit now with his hand in mine
but i know he cant feel

no one knows
whats done is done
its as if he were dead

im close with his mother
and she cries endlessly
lord how we miss him
at least whats remembered
its so important to make best friends in life
but its hard when my friend sits with blank expressions

no one knows
whats done is done
its as if he were dead

he as hollow as i alone now
he as hollow as i alone
a shell of my friend
just flesh and bone
theres no soul
he sees no love
i shake my fists at skies above
mad at god

he as hollow as i converse
i wish hed waken from this curse
hear my words before its through
i want to come in after you
my best friend

he as hollow as i alone

 strength beyond strength


there is nothing
no education
no family life to open my arms to
youd say that my job is today yet gone tomorrow
ill be broke in a gutter

i know the opinion
a broken record
fuck you and your college dream
fact is were stronger than all

youre working for perfect bodies
perfect minds and perfect neighbors
but im helping to legalize dope on your pristine streets
and im making a fortune

youre muscle and gall
naive at best
im bone brain and cock
deep down stronger than all

a sad state of affairs
a crippled america
a pipe dream buttfucked
immune stronger than all

a lament for a rookie officer punk ass weak little lamb
for the mob truly does rule at this particular time

weve grown into a monster
an arrogant explosive motherfuck
hard as a rock shut like a lock
finally the president in submission
he holds out his hand on your television and draws back a stump
its too late for some far too late

no more holdbacks no more paying a cops paycheck
let him bust his own child
the son that heeds my word and smokes my dope
the daughter that sucks me off and snorts cheap anything

hail kings
the new kings
stronger than all

a simple process to legalize
there would not be a choice but to take our side
be there no question of certain strengths
know this intention
forever stronger than all


 becoming


a long time ago i never knew myself
then the memory of shame birthed its gift

no more the small one the weak one the frightened one
running from beatings deflating
im becoming more than a man
more than you ever were
driven and burning to rise beyond jesus

im born again with snakes eyes
becoming godsize

i found my life was slipping through my hands
perhaps through death my life wont be so bad

i can see you can fuck you inside of you
staring through your eyes
belittle your friends to serve me to suck me
to realize my saving grasp
i of suicide
i the unlord

im born again with snakes eyes
becoming godsize


  minutes alone


i see you had your mind all made up
you group of pitiful liars
before i woke to face the day
your master plan transpired
something told me
this job had more to meet the eye
my song is not believed
my words somewhat deceiving
now im unwhole

bridge
youve waged a war of nerves
but you cant crush the kingdom
cant be what your idols are
cant leave the scar
you cry for compensation
i ask you please just give us

chorus
 minutes alone

i read your eyes your mind was made up
you took me for a fool
you used complexion of my skin
for a counter racist tool
you cant burn me
ive spilled my guts out in the past
taken advantage of
because you know where ive come
my past

bridge

chorus

solo

chorus

i ask you please just give us


 im broken


i wonder if well smile in our coffins
while loved ones mourn the day
the absence of our faces
living laughing eyes awake
is this too much for them to take

too young for ones conclusion the lifestyle won
such values you taught your son
thats how

look at me now
im broken
inherit my life

one day we all will die a cliched fact of life
force fed to make us heed
inbred to sponge our bleed
every warning a leaking rubber
a poison apple for mingled blood

too young for ones delusion the lifestyle cost
venereal mother embrace the loss
thats how

look at you now
youre broken
inherit your life


 good friends and a bottle of pills


i fucked your girlfriend last night
while you snored and drooled i fucked your love
she called me daddy
and i called her baby when i smacked her ass
i called her sugar when i ate her alive till daylight
and i slept with her all over me
from forehead to ribcage i dripped her ass
sometimes i thought you might be spying
living out some brash fantasy but no
you were knocked out
but we were all knocked out you know
in a way

i serve too many masters

we didnt know youd break the bottle
that the magic came in to use those jagged shards
to cut our wrists and neck
and youd do it too youre that kind of dude
but you wouldnt know what you were doing
because i didnt
your girlfriend could have been a burn victim
an amputee a dead body
but god damn i wanted to fuck

im losing whats left of my fucking mind
i serve too many fucking masters

i told you i told you motherfucker


 hard lines sunken cheeks


as a child i was given the gift to entertain you
but through blood i inherited a life that could destroy you

i drink all day i smoke all day
i took your daughters breath away
ive done it all but tap the vein
these hard lines and sunken cheeks are text book reasons
all these christians come alive and try to sell you

my soul for a goat yet ill outlive the old

you know its bad some may say sad
a hangover is inspiration
like a junkie i hurt for it
a bad trip the emptiness

i never sleep or always sleep
a lack of fulfillment to me is me
the big picture
these hard lines and sunken cheeks
are part of what the christians mean
to immortalize my situation

my soul for a goat yet ill outlive the old

embrace some religion
to get close to some undivine ejaculation point
simply to thy ghost i cling
simply to thy ghost i reject
simply to thy ghost i give spit

tempter tempting tempt me molest me
you know that ill submit
for this is my weakness
and it saves me from relationships
with those christians you know theyll sell you

my soul for a goat yet ill outlive the old


 slaughtered


ones own kingman
christ person woman god
at battle with a mass astrengent
the bond that blends the weak to the wise

its a safe assumption
that youd want to save me now
but ill never face castration
for your sacred sow is left

slaughtered

brainwashed by me
myself influence i
bird brained
world saver
a fake god rests dead inside you

its a safe assumption
that youd want to save me now
but ill never face castration
for your sacred sow is left

slaughtered

system destroyed exposed and unployed
the fruit of intention
cry for their dead but turning their head
to ignore realitys claw
knife to your wrist syringe in your arm
is your ounce of prevention
give what you made
and under your name on your grave is salvation

a big fucking joke

slaughter the pig the self righteous king
for your own restoration
god is in your chest and faith kills what is precious
for death is unanswered

slaughtered

do sin x


  years


i vent my frustration at you old man
after years your ears will hear

you screamed you tried
its words of a weakling
and promises made by a liar drunken liar

now you pick up that splintered chair
that was aiming for your head

a head that should have been long ago kicked in by me
alone

i wont lose a second of sleep for this

dont touch me
no
ever again
dont touch me
dont touch me
dont touch me

orphaned to the dope and drinks
i learned my lesson well somehow from you

no tears cant clutch my regrets
but these years of detachment
have left me with demons now surfacing
im becoming more than nothing

you never knew the answers to any of my questions did you
you made up all the answers to my unimportant existence

but now you dont have to dump me off

not again
dont touch me
dont touch me
dont touch me
fuck no

ever again
dont touch me
dont touch me
dont touch me
fuck no
dont touch me
never again

i vow lest i die tomorrow

youll never be the father i am
the bastard father to the thousands
of the ugly criticized the unwanted
the ones with fathers just like you
were fucking you back

im shoving my life right down your throat
can i find the guts
can i feel the heart
look at the ground as you choke me up
does it taste like tequila
or failure

were fucking you back
fucking you back
were fucking you back
fucking you back


 shedding skin


i dont want you to look at me while
im shedding skin
i cant afford for you to see whats in
id rather shoot myself than have you watch me
i feel youd steal my skin to try and wear me

i was betrayed one more day of my short life
you were carried away you had no shame
to suffocate my being
i was me but you werent you
you were sticking to me like a scab
so i peeled you away and bled for days
then stepped out of myself

im shedding skin changing within im falling in
through swollen eyes i dreamed you died caught inside
im shedding skin spreading thin severed stem
i created the end im killing a friend im shedding my skin

i dont think you belong in here
i feel im sick
dont ask because you know damn well where ive been
ive kept a simple woman through the thick and thin
but ive found the guts to sever from my siamese twin

i throw you away everyday a dead part of life
strangling back seething black
in between my longing for torture
blood on my face that came from your face
the mix of kissing and bleeding
i put you away i shut you away
i pissed you away i threw you away

im shedding skin changing within im falling in
through swollen eyes i dreamed you died caught inside
im shedding skin spreading thin severed stem
i created the end im killing a friend im shedding my skin

youre fucking and sucking
youre friendless its endless
your flower has soured
its endless youre friendless
its harder and stronger
but no ones been inside you longer
or harder or deeper
to get you off you need the fear

its never love bloody touch
broken wrist needle rust
choking throat swallowed teeth
head fuck no peace
im shedding my skin to peel you off of me
youve got to love me

ornament shrunken head
playtoy snake strike
poisonous syphilis
drenched me soaked me
im shedding my skin to drain you out of me
youve got to hate me


 use my third arm


enlight your sense of thought of touch
of real a shield an underground for this coward
building a blood in water scent
its like some raping
without judgement
boy in a pocket
balls in a bag
serve and protect you
his dick his gun his brain his badge

a faster way to kill them all would take too goddamn long
absorb through pores the great escape

kill that fuck to show him up
equal his displeasure now
stab his ass a reminded past of what the fuck we live for

ourselves

arm yourself a branch a third arm
extend your health crawl inside euphoria
building a blood in water scent
its like a scraping its entrapment
boy in a pocket
balls in a bag
perverted handle
his getting by is a fisted fuck

a faster way to exterminate them takes too fucking
long absorb through pores the great escape

kill that fuck to show him up
equal his displeasure now
stab his ass a reminded past of what the fuck we live for

ourselves

halfassed for most his life
piss poor little ham
narc boy a fake fuck limp dick
sucking up to the man
and the world
we need a fucking cold war

building a blood in water scent
its like a raping
without judgement
boy in a pocket
balls in a bag
perverted handle
his dick his gun his brain his badge

kill that fuck to show him up
equal your displeasure now
stab his ass a reminded past of what the fuck were living for

our fucking selves


 throes of rejection


this is feeding what i am

its like salt poured into a deep infected wound
its the type of pain you really dig and long for
ive always been insecure to open up and show love
some pretty girl with long hair some bald guy writhing

rejection

the kind thats self induced
the tongue thats bitten through
the nauseating stab
is feeding what i am

a short fuse

if there really is a god then its punishing me constantly
she let me taste that sugarhole and of course i wanted more
but no im reduced to a rohypnol snort and a lot of drinks
this shit goes on and on just look down my pants

rejection
it aint a fucking game
my human dick to blame
a sociopathic plan
is feeding what i am

rejection
takes life away from eyes
will give you to the skies
it makes me more than a man
is drowning what i am


 planet caravan


black sabbath song taken from the paranoid album

we sail through endless skies
stars shine like eyes
the black night sighs

the moon in silver trees
falls down in tears
light of the night

the earth a purple blaze
of sapphire haze
in orbit always

while down below the trees
bathed in cool breeze
silver starlight breaks down the night

and so we pass on by the crimson eye
of great god mars
as we travel the universe
