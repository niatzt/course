/22/
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah-ah, ah-ah

It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew.)
Ah-ah, ah-ah

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, twenty-two

It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights, we won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you

Ooh, ooh, yeah, hey!

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
(I don't know about you)
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
(You don't know about me)
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
(Dance like we're)
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (oh-woah-oh)
Twenty-two (dancing like)
Twenty-two (yeah, yeah)
Twenty-two (yeah, yeah, yeah)

It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), we won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), you look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
/A Perfectly Good Heart/
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs,
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes,
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, 
I still can't believe,
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but:

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
/A Place In This World/
I don't know what I want,
So, don't ask me,
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking,
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one,
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on
My old blue jeans,
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today,
Got the sunshine,
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery,
Oh yeah, but, that's okay

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl, 
On a mission
But, I'm ready to fly

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on

Oh, I'm alone,
On my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
/All Too Well/
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold, but something 'bout it felt like home
Somehow and I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide eyed gaze
We're singing in a car
Getting lost upstate

The autumn leaves falling down
Like pieces into place
And I can picture it
After all these days

And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And it might be okay
But I'm not fine at all

'Cause here we are again
On that little town street
You almost ran the red
'Cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on my counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid
With glasses in a twin size bed

And your mother's telling stories
'Bout you on the t-ball team
You tell me about your past
Thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause here we are again
In the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen
In the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up

Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

Hey, you called me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel
In the name of being honest

I'm a crumbled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly
It's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it

After plaid shirt days
And nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
And I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again
Where I loved you so
Back before you lost the one
Real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
/Back To December/
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was "Goodbye"

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time
/Beautiful Eyes/
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes
I think of you late at night
I don't know why
I want to be somewhere where you are
I want to be where...

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while... I cry
Cause you're my lullaby
So baby come hold me tight cause I - I
I want to be everything you need
I want to be where...

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

Just as long as you're mine
I'll be you're everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about
Dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, eyes...beautiful eyes
/Begin Again/
Took a deep breath in the mirror 
He didn't like it when I wore high heels but I do 
Turned the lock and put my headphones on 
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do 

Walked in expecting you'd be late 
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you 
You pulled my chair out and helped me in
And you don't know how nice that is 
But I do 

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
I think it's strange that you think I¡¯m funny 'cause he never did 
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does 
Is break and burn and end 
But on a Wednesday in a caf¨¦, I watched it begin again 

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you 
But I do 
We tell stories and you don't know why I'm coming off a little shy 
But I do 

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did 
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does 
Is break and burn and end 
But on a Wednesday in a caf¨¦, I watched it begin again 

And we walk down the block to my car 
And I almost brought him up 
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that 
For the first time, what's past is past 

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did 
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does 
Is break and burn and end 
But on a Wednesday in a caf¨¦, I watched it begin again 
But on a Wednesday in a caf¨¦, I watched it begin again
/Better Than Revenge/
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and lets hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
But she's better known
For things that she does on the mattress, woah

Soon she's gonna find 
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind 
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party
And she's on the list 
She looks at me like I'm a trend
And she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
She thinks I'm psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you want to go
They don't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
But she's better known
For things that she does on the mattress, woah

Soon she's gonna find 
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind 
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but haven't you heard

I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but, I always get the last word

Woah

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
But she's better known
For things that she does on the mattress, woah

Soon she's gonna find 
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind 
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
Cause I don't think you do
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do
Don't think you do

Lets hear the applause
Come on show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
Cause you're so much better

She took him faster than you can say sabotage!
/Breathe/
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm 
Mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm 

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie 
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe
Without you, but I have to

Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe
Without you, but I have to

Its two a.m., feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
Its two a.m., feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

I can't breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe
Without you, but I have to

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
/Change/
And it¡¯s a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it¡¯s all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you¡¯re getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I¡¯ll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
We sing hallelujah, we sing hallelujah

So we¡¯ve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It¡¯s hard to fight when the fight ain¡¯t fair
We¡¯re getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we¡¯re faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don¡¯t need this
But there¡¯s something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
We sing hallelujah, we sing hallelujah

Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we¡¯ve worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it¡¯s the fight of our lives
But we¡¯ll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Do you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It¡¯s a revolution, throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And we sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah
/Cold As You/
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So, I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls,
And paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there loving you,
And wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story,
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
So, just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody,
If I died, died for you, died for you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you
/Come Back... Be Here/
You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then you catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, "Don't get attached."
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in 
I don't wanna miss you like this 
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

The delicate, beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much 
Without knowing anything at all 
And now that I can't put this down 

If I had known what I know now 
I never would've played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets 
That never bring you back to me 
I can't help but wish you took me with you 

And this is when the feeling sinks in 
I don't wanna miss you like this 
Come back, be here 
Come back, be here

I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away

In New York, be here
But you're in London
And I break down
This is not fair
That you're not around

And this is when the feeling sinks in 
I don't wanna miss you like this 
Come back, be here 
Come back, be here 

I guess you're in New York today 
I don't wanna need you this way 
Come back, be here 
Come back, be here

I don't wanna miss you like this

Come back, be here
Come back, be here
/Come In With The Rain/
I could go back,
To every laugh,
But, I don't want to go there anymore
And I know all the steps, 
Up to your door
But, I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind
Talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why,
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open,
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up,
And sing you a song
But, I don't want to have to go that far
And I, I got you down
I know you by heart,
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself
Talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here,
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open,
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long,
Screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

But, I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired tonight for all these games
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back,
To every laugh,
But, I don't want to go there anymore
/Crazier/
I've never gone with the wind
Just let it flow, let it take me
Where it wants to go
'Til you opened the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly, but I couldn't find wings
Then you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I watched from a distance as you
Made life your own, every sky was
Your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know
How that would feel and you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Baby, you showed me what living is for
I don't want to hide anymore

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Crazier, Crazier
/Dear John/
Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine

You paint a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why

Dear John,
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can

Dear John,
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

Dear John,
I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young 
To be played by your dark twisted games?
When I loved you so

I should've known

You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests 
All the girls that you run dry
Have dried lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out

But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks 
Over your sad empty town

Dear John,
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song

You should've known.
You should've known.

Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known.
/Enchanted/
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered have we met?
Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you

All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing on the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM... who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake

And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
Hey, it was enchanting to meet you

All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know

This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again

These are the words I held back
As I was leaning to say
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, dancing round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
/Eyes Open/
Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your eye-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings

In backyards
Winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eye-eyes open
Keep your eye-eyes open
Keep your eye-eyes open

So here you are
Two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far

But turn around
Oh, they've surrounded you with a showdown
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got something they don't, yeah you got something they don't
You just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eye-eyes open
Keep your eye-eyes open
Keep your eye-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night grows dark
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eye-eyes open
Keep your eye-eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eye-eyes open
Keep your eye-eyes open
Keep your eye-eyes open
Keep your eye-eyes open
Keep your eye-eyes open
/Fearless/
There's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah

We're drivin' down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

So baby drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment, now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
It's fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
/Fifteen/
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around, before

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be, fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date
And he's got a car, and you're feelin' like flyin'
And your Mama's waitin' up, and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends, when the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss, makes your head spin round
But, in your life you'll do things greater than, datin' the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted, was to be wanted
Wish you could go back, and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind 
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything, and just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be, at fifteen

La-la-la la-la-la la la la la
La-la-la la-la-la la la la la
La-la-la la-la-la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
/Forever & Always/
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened, please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything 
Coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going? 
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so, ohh

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it, baby
You said forever and always, yeah
/Girl At Home/
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But honey, I am no one's exception
This I have previously learned

So don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that, uh oh

Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

I see you turn off your phone
And now you got me alone
And I say
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that, uh oh

Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone
And I say
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

Call a cab
Lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab
Lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that, uh oh

Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her
/Haunted/
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break

It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And It's coming over you 
Like it's all a big mistake

Woah holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on 
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted

Come on, come on 
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Stood there, 
Watched you walk away from everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time 
I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on 
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted

Come on, come on 
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

I know
I know

I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone
No!

Come on, come on 
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started

Come on, come on 
Don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Ohhh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Though I never thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it...
/Hey Stephen/
Hey Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold

Hey Stephen
Boy you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic
I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself

Hey Stephen
I've been holdin' back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all so I thought that
I'd never see nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk, way you talk
Way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful
Don't you ever change

Hey Stephen
Why are people always leaving? 
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic
I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights
You're perfect for me 
Why aren't you here tonight
I'm waiting alone now
So come on and come out and pull me near
Shine, shine, shine

Hey Stephen
I could give you fifty reasons why
I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic
I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic
I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself

Myself
Can't help myself
I can't help myself
/Holy Ground/
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone
And Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme

Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we¡¯d made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of "I need you."
And for the first time I had something to lose

And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story¡¯s got dust on every page
Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I¡¯m gonna dance for all that we¡¯ve been through
But I don¡¯t wanna dance if I¡¯m not dancing with you
Tonight, I¡¯m gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don¡¯t wanna dance if I¡¯m not dancing with you

It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I¡¯m gonna dance for all that we¡¯ve been through
But I don¡¯t wanna dance if I¡¯m not dancing with you
Tonight, I¡¯m gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don¡¯t wanna dance if I¡¯m not dancing with you
/I Almost Do/
I bet this time of night you¡¯re still up
I bet you¡¯re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you¡¯re sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don¡¯t
I almost do, I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
¡®Cause each time you reach out, there¡¯s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can¡¯t say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don¡¯t
I almost do, I almost do

Whoa, we made quite a mess, baby
It¡¯s probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams you¡¯re touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don¡¯t
I almost do, I almost do

I bet this time of night you¡¯re still up
I bet you¡¯re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you¡¯re sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
/I Heart/
Wish I had concentrated,
They said love was complicated,
But it's something I just fell into
And it was over-rated,
But just look what I created,
I came out alive but i'm black and blue
But boy you ask me if I'm all right
Think about what I had to do, yeah

Wake up, smell the break-up
Fix my heart put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an "I heart question mark" written on the back of my hand

I'd be fine if you just walked by,
But you had to talk about why 
You were wrong and I was right
But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home, cry like a baby 
Wait right by the phone every night

And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through
I had to

Wake up, smell the break-up
Fix my heart put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an "I heart question mark" written on the back of my hand

And when you're home all alone at night
You still wonder why
You took everything i had away but
I haven't thought about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know someday you will

Wake up, smell the break-up
Realize that we won't make up
It didn't go the way you planned
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I got an "I heart question mark" written on the back of my hand
Written on the back of my hand
An "I heart question mark" yeah written on the back of my hand
/I Knew You Were Trouble/
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me

I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in (You were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
/If This Was A Movie/
Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking about everything we've been through
Maybe I've been back going too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
Because nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall
Chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothing's going to change, not for me and you
That before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door
And I'd say

Come back, come back, come back to me like you would
Before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I let you walk
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you'd want to see now
Baby, what about the ending
I thought you'd be here by now
Thought you'd be here by now
/I¡¯m Only Me When I¡¯m With You/
Friday night beneath the stars,
In a field behind your yard,
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing,
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time,
The other half I'm only trying to,
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl,
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets all my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time,
The other half I'm only trying to,
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else,
It's so hard to be myself,
Only you can see

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time,
The other half I'm only trying to,
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me, who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you,
With you
/Innocent/
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?
It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you'd seen what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
And everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep?
Before the monsters caught up to you?
It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to
Be brand new
It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
Lost your balance on the tightrope
It's never too late to get back
/Invisible/
She can't see the way your eyes,
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare,
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her,
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you,
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you,
Like I want to
You just see right through me,
But, if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable,
Instead of just invisible

There's a fire inside of you,
That can¡¯t help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light,
No matter what you do
And all I think about,
Is how to make you think of me,
And everything that we could be

I just wanna show you,
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you,
Like I want to
You just see right through me,
But, if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable,
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we¡¯re invisible
I just wanna look in your eyes,
And make you realize

I just wanna show you,
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you,
Let me want you
You just see right through me,
But, if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable,
Instead of just invisible

She can't see the way your eyes,
Light up when you smile
/Jump Then Fall/
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face
Oh, I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I've ever wanted
I had time to think it over and all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me 
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa, I need you baby
Don't be afraid, please jump then fall, jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all 
So jump then fall

Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here, baby
I'll show you, I'll show you you can

Jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah
/Last Kiss/
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me so why did you go away?

If I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement I ran off the plane
That July ninth
The beat of your heart 
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name
Forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing but for you I did

Because I love your handshake meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes
And all that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name
Forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures
Like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are

Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

Never thought we'd have our last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss

Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last
/Long Live/
I said, "remember this moment"
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live 
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined 
Just for me and you

I was screaming
Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said, "Remember this feeling?"
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now.

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
'Cuz for a moment a band of thieves in ripped-up jeans
Got to rule the world.

Long live 
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined 
Just for me and you

I was screaming
Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

I was screaming
Long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall.

Can you take a moment;
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever,
But if, God forbid, fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live 
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you.

Long live 
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined 
Just for me and you

I was screaming
Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing, Long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
FIghting dragons with you

And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered.
/Love Story/
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On the balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello."
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
/Mary¡¯s Song/
She said "I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
The pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the house and the backyard trees
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
You never did
Took me back when the world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I
Oh, my, my, my

Well I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes,
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. running in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Took me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside
'Till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my

A few years have gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came
And our mamas cried
You said "I do"
And I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time
You and I

I'll be eighty seven
You'll be eighty nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
Oh, my, my, my
/Mean/
You, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again, got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

Well, you can take me down 
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides and your walk-by lies and your humiliation
You, have pointed out my flaws again as if I don't already see them
I'll walk with my head down trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I'll bet you got pushed around, somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now, 'cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar, talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion, but nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

Someday, I'll be, living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
/Mine/
You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

(Oh yeah)
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)
Yes, yes we're gonna make it now (hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it (come on, come on)
I can see it now
/Never Grow Up/
Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light

To you everything's funny
You've got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom is dropping you off
At 14 there is just so much you cant do
And you cant wait to move out someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
Don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up


Take pictures in your mind
Of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like
When your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps
Remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs

I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Oh I dont wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple

Oh darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up

Don't you ever grow up
Never grow up
Just never grow up
/Our Song/
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,
The other on my heart
I look around, 
Turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on,
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, 
Listened to the radio,
Waited for something to come along,
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin,
And I wrote down our song
/Ours/
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, cause right now you're mine

And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The waters rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you

Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high
The waters rough
But this love is ours
/Picture To Burn/
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...
/Red/
Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, 
Ending so suddenly

Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red,loving him was red

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you'd never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red, oh, red, burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head,in burning red
Burning, it was red

Losing him was blue like I'd ever known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
'Cause loving him was red, yeah, yeah, red we're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
/Sad Beautiful Tragic/
Long handwritten note
Deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean
When you're a little too late

I stood right by the tracks
Your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be
And long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in long conversation
We both wake in lonely beds
In different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and darling
They all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs
Off its tracks

Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up and for the life of us
We can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
/Safe & Sound/
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby
Even when the music's gone, gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
/Should¡¯ve Said No/
It's strange to think,
The songs we used to sing,
The smiles,
The flowers,
Everything is gone

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you,
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back,
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe,
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

Oh, I can't resist
Before you go,
Tell me this,
Was it worth it,
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me
/Sparks Fly/
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
Your the kinda reckless that should send me run
But I kinda know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't
See what I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see Sparks Fly
Whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes
Baby as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me
When you're not around
Cause I see Sparks Fly
Whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's
Really something you find I'm even better
Than you imagined I would be

I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but
I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see Sparks Fly
Whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes
Baby as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me
When you're not around
Cause I see Sparks Fly
Whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you baby
Like a firework show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see Sparks Fly
Whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes
Baby as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me
When you're not around
Cause I see Sparks Fly
Whenever you smile
When the sparks fly
Oh baby smile
When the sparks fly
/Speak Now/
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don¡¯t say "Yes", run away now
I¡¯ll meet you when you¡¯re out of the church at the back door
Don¡¯t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don¡¯t you?

Don¡¯t say "Yes", run away now
I¡¯ll meet you when you¡¯re out of the church at the back door
Don¡¯t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Don¡¯t say "Yes", run away now
I¡¯ll meet you when you¡¯re out of the church at the back door
Don¡¯t wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"

Oh, run away
La la, oh oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There¡¯s the silence, there¡¯s my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I¡¯m only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

Don¡¯t say "Yes", run away now
I¡¯ll meet you when you¡¯re out of the church at the back door
Don¡¯t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
And you¡¯ll say "Let¡¯s run away now
I¡¯ll meet you when I¡¯m out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn¡¯t say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"
/Starlight/
I said "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I'm a Barbie on the boardwalk
Summer of '45
Picked me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen
And crazy, running wild, wild

Can't remember what song
It was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

I said "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said "Look at you, worrying too much about,
Things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that away."

He was trying to skip rocks
On the ocean saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines

And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?
/State Of Grace/
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles' heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
/Stay Beautiful/
Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch his as he's walking home
Saying does he know
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So, I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make conversation,
When he's takin' my breath away
I should say,
Hey, by the way

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
stay beautiful

If you and I are a story,
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream,
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but, if it don't

Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

Oh, if it don't,
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
/Stay Stay Stay/
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turnaway
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said "Okay, let's talk."

And I said "Stay, stay, stay.
I've been loving you,
For quite some time, time, time."
You think that it's funny
When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
I love you because you have given me no choice

But to stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you
For quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny
When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time

All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life

Stay
And I'll be loving you
For quite some time
No one else is gonna love me

When I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best
If we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you
For quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny

When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you
For quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny
When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay

That's so fun!
/Superman/
Tall, dark and Superman
He puts his papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mothers eyes and his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yeah

And you'll smile and say how are you
I'll say just fine
I always forget to tell you I love you
I'll love you forever

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watched Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday he'll take me away
And save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me singing
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they said

You'll leave, got places to be
And I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watched Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget
About me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love struck, and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget
Where I'll be

Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the car was from you
Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around (forever and ever)
And I watched Superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

When you come back down
/Super Star/
This is wrong but
I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face

And I knew from the first note played I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today you'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
And you smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar
/Teardrops On My guitar/
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
/Tell Me Why/
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around

And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on 
How to ruin someone's perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated, 
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around

And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind

And I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love then you push me around

Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why, why, tell me why

I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof, now you know
/The Best Day/
I'm five years old 
Its getting cold out, got my big coat on 
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you 
I run and run, past the pumpkin patch, and the tractor rides 
Look now, the sky is gold 
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home 

I dont know why all the trees change in the fall 
I know youre not scared of anything at all 
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away 
But I know I had the best day with you today 

I'm thirteen now 
And dont know how my friends could be so mean 
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys 
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away 
And we talk and window shop til I forgot all their names 

I dont know who I'm gonna talk to now at school 
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you 
Dont know how long its gonna take to feel ok 
But I know I had the best day with you today 

I have an excellent father 
His strength is making me stronger 
God smiles on my little brother 
Inside and out hes better than I am 
I grew up in a pretty house 
And I had space to run 
And I had the best days with you 

There is a video I found from back when I was three 
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me 
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs 
And daddys smart and youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world 

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
And I love you for giving me your eyes 
Staying back and watching me shine 
And I didnt know if you knew so I'm taking this chance to say 
That I had the best day with you today
/The Lucky One/
New to town with a made-up name,
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream

You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they¡¯ll tell you now
You¡¯re the lucky one
Yeah, they tell you now
You¡¯re the lucky one
But can you tell me now
You¡¯re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

Now it¡¯s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you¡¯ll make it out alive

And they¡¯ll tell you now
You¡¯re the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now
You¡¯re the lucky one

Can you tell me now
You¡¯re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out

They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now

¡®Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now
You¡¯re the lucky one
Let me tell you now
You¡¯re the lucky one
Let me tell you now
You¡¯re the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh

Yeah, they'll tell you now
You¡¯re the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now
You¡¯re the lucky one

Can you tell me now
You¡¯re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
/The Moment I Knew/
You should have been there
Should have burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here." smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking

People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress

And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall

And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress

And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When ears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should have been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress

And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you."
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

Ooh, I knew.

You call me later
And say "I'm sorry I didn't make it."
And I say "I'm sorry, too."
And that was the moment I knew
/The Other Side Of The Door/
In the heat of the fight
I walked away.
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay.
I said "This time I had enough."
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not pickin' up.
'cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over.
But if you look a little closer

I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
Screaming: "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain,
Come back for more!
And don't you leave,
'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door.

Me and my stupid pride
Sittin' here alone.
Going through the photographs,
Staring at the phone.
I keep going back over
The things we both said.
And I remember the slammin' door,
And all the things that I misread.
Baby you know everything,
Tell me why you couldn't see
That when I left I wanted you to
Chase after me? Yeah,

I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
Screaming: "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain,
Come back for more!
And don't you leave,
'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door.

And I scream out the window
"I can't even look at you, I don't need you!",
But I do, I do, I do...
"See, there's nothing you can say
To make right again, I mean it, I mean it!",
What I mean is:

I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
Screaming: "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain,
Come back for more
And don't you leave,
'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door.

With your face,
And your beautiful eyes,
And the conversation,
With the little white lies.
And the faded picture
Of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car
Up the stairs
And I broke-down cryin'
Was it worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything, I must confess,
I need you
/The Outside/
I didn't know,
What I would find,
When I went lookin' for a reason
I know,
I didn't read,
Between the lines,
And baby I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever,
try to be better
Nobody ever, 
let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, 
But never knew
That I would give it all just to be
A part of this,
A part of you
And now it's all too late
So you see,
You could have helped if you had wanted to
But, no one notices until it's too late to do anything

So how can I ever,
try to be better
Nobody ever, 
let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, yeah
How can I ever,
try to be better
Nobody ever, 
let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh oh
Ah, oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
/The Story Of Us/
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say 'they're the lucky ones'

I used to know my place
was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh a simple complication, 
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
Like its killing me, yeah

I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter!

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me

I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride, like you should've held me

Oh I'm scared to see the ending 
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
Like its killing me, yeah

I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
Like its killing me, yeah

I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Now Now Now

And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you?
Like it's killing me
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end.
/The way I Loved You/
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicating 
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
/Tied Together With A Smile/
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty,
But, that's not true 'cause I know you

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted,
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But, he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone
You're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

Goodbye, baby,
With a smile
Baby, baby, oh
/Tim McGraw/
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night

And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me, mmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
/Today Was A Fairytale/
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand
And you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey T-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make
Everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense
Till the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Oh, oh, yeah, oh
Today was a fairytale
/Treacherous/
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity is too much

And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay

And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine
Through the sleepless night
And I will get you,
Will get you alone

Your name has echoed
Through my mind
And I just think you should,
Think you should know

That nothing safe is
Worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Two headlights shine
Through the sleepless night
And I will get you,
Will get you alone

Your name has echoed
Through my mind
And I just think you should,
Think you should know

That nothing safe is
Worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it
/Untouchable/
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky.
I'm reachin out and I just can't tell you why.
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you.
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun,
And when you're close I feel like coming undone.

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven.

It's half full and I won't wait here all day.
I know you're sayin that you'd be here anyway.
But you're untouchable burning brighter than the sun,
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone.

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
Come on, come on, oh

In the middle of the night we could form this dream.
I wanna feel you by my side, standin next to me.
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven.

Oh, Oh. 
I'm caught up in you. 
Oh, Oh, Oh.

Untouchable burnin brighter than the sun,
And when you're close I feel like comin undone.
You gotta, come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin out your name
You gotta, come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven.
/We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough"
'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space...what?

Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say "I hate you," we break up, you call me, I love you

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together...like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh (Yeah)
Ooh (Yeah)
Ooh (Yeah)
Oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say "Never say never..."

(Sigh)...So he calls me up, and he's like, "I still love you," and I¡¯m like, I mean this is exhausting. You know, like we are never getting back together. Like, ever.

No, we are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, ooh, getting back together
We, ooh, oh, getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever...getting back together
/White Horse/
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel, comes out, just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth, all this time, 'cause I honestly believed in, you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should have known, I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes, and never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love, you had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted, but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday, who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Try and catch me now oh-oh
It's too late, to catch me now
/You Belong With Me/
You're on the phone with your girlfriend she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't, get your humor
Like I do

I'm in my room it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never, know your story
Like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and, I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day, when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for, has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm, the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey isn't this, easy

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey what ya doin' with a girl like that

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and, I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day, when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for, has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm, the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you, drivin' to my house, in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm, the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me, have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me, you belong with me
/You¡¯ve Not Sorry/
All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances everytime
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby but I've figured you out
And you thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't want to hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby 
Like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, no, no

Looking so innocent
I might believe you
If I didn't know
Could have loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting 
In the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't want to hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby 
Like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby 
Like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh...
