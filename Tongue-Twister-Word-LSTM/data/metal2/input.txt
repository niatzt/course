"Some men... just wanna watch the world burn."
Suicide obsession in a world of betray,
Taunted into silence and then bury the rage,
Deep depression darkness fed, pull the trigger count the dead.
Contradict of faith, out to devastate,
Crazed disposition underlining deceit,
Killing without reason for no cause or belief,
Deadly imposition, out of touch and deranged,
One with god half insane
Wage of sanctity, tears and agony,
Ancient and bizarre Satan's repertoire.
In the minds of evil, fear imposed by design,
In the minds of evil, kill till everything dies!
Twisted by religion and fanatical hate,
In the line of fire devastation in place,
Homicidal mission of tyrannical lust,
Fatal inquisition for the spilling of blood,
Don't care what you've done, death to everyone,
It's no mystery, destroy you and me.
In the minds of evil, fear imposed by his design,
In the minds of evil,death to all of mankind.....die
In the minds of evil, burn in hell and die.....and die!
In the minds of evil, fear imposed by design,
In the minds of evil, death to all of mankind.
I curse the air you breathe
All men of the cloth
What was will never be
Your cause is lost
Faith put to death
Civil unrest
Gospel of pain
Burning the cross
The good book is tossed
Destroy thy name
Trinity bleed
Squandered in greed
God in his grave
Disposed humanity
Decrepit and defaced
Inferior and weak
The light you seek
Heaven deceased
Dead in belief
Disgraced and maimed
Church of disgust
Turn into rust
Converts refrain
Master of none
Religion done
Scripture erased
Thou begone
Unbelieved
Left for dead
Thou begone
Reckoning
No moral compass left
Echoing - Undermined
God the son
Horrified
Slave to a tragedy
Suffer in agony
Die!
Slave to thee
Under us
Thou begone
Philistine
Efface of empty threats
Cowering
Undivine
God the son
Holy calamity
Death to hypocrisy
Die!
Heaven reviled conspire deceit,
Revelled in heinous reward,
Wiping out missions who faltered and fiend,
Turning your back to the wants of the lord...
Destroying all Christians of faith and belief,
Plaguing infection and pain,
Taunting his vision for everything lost,
Collapse the world in a righteous display,
Impending death for partaking in blasphemy,
The end to all for he ones who will not believe,
Evading time and discard to entitlement,
A wailing wall of destruction of innocence...
Godkill, Godkill
Killing his own and avoiding defeat,
Ravage the word from his throne,
Willfully murder with conscious and ease,
Spilling the blood of the young and the old,
Slaughtered and scattered the end is imposed
Doomed by the rage of his grace,
Future of sorrow defending his name,
No one or nothing will ever be saved..
Destroy the will of a lord who waits your death
Bring forth the end to the threats and his sacraments.
Father far from hell,
Master of all, spare none of thy wrath,
Destroy this world.....
Godkill, Godkill
Misery falling from heaven above,
Splendor exploding unfazed,
No more tomorrow impaled nazarene,
Bury the book and along with this name...
God and religion a future unknown,
Darkness uncovered his word,
Rebuke his call and expulsion of guilt,
Think for yourself and just do as thou wilt.
The blood of Christ quenches my thirst...
Heavenly led, cast to the dead
If you believe the illusion
Died for your sins, dissension begins
The powers of Christ will repel you
Masses deceived, fall to temptation
Thorns on your head, welcome
Welcome to your death
We're beyond salvation
Below the reach of god
The end of all religion
To fight the war as one
Blasphemy, engaging in war
Rapture the whore
We're beyond salvation
Below the reach of god
Invert the false messiah
and desecrate the son
Deny the cross
Invert his cause
The blood of Christ quenches my thirst...
Stopped and I stare, stones in the air
A witness to your execution
No one repents as they're watching you die
Death to the kingdom of heaven.
Masses deceived, fall to temptation
Thorns on your head, welcome
Welcome to your death
We're beyond salvation
Below the reach of god
The end of all religion
To fight the war as one
Blasphemy, engaging in war
Rapture the whore
We're beyond salvation
Below the reach of god
Invert the false messiah
and desecrate the son
Deny the cross
Invert his cause
Failure, claim to fame, abject the soul, ending your own dream, you closed that door!
The end of time has come for you and him are done,
Dissension has begun the misery of one.
Liars, petty thieves, out for their own, sadness turn to grief, the truth now known.
Now take your place with god, unburdened by your thought,
You got just what you want, a life of pain and loss.
Dooming oneself for one selfish belief,
Only yourself by yourself was deceived, nobody wants to remember your name,
Only what if's now remain in your place, seen for the fraud that you put on display,
Live with your actions while digging your grave, choke on the truth, slap to the face,
Life without you is a much better place.
A wish of death, no hope for happiness,
The flame of wealth, no more of yours to delve,
Concurred defeat is all you'll ever reach,
Embraced your hell, as long as time will tell.
Failure, claim to fame, abject the soul, ending your own dreams, you closed that door!
The end of time has come for you and him are done,
Dissension has begun the misery of one.
Death, I wait the pain
A stare that's cold and burns my eyes
Victim, deception
Death to your shrine
Those I've lost appear before me
The end of life, the air turning colder
I close my eyes and brace for eternity
Prevailing thoughts, a vanishing soul
Death, I wait the pain
A stare that's cold and burns my eyes
Victim, deception
Death to your shrine
My body decays, the skin falls away
Death to myself
Between the flesh and the void,
Between the flesh and the void
Death, I wait the pain
A stare that's cold and burns my eyes
Victim, deception
Death to your shrine
My body decays, the skin falls away
Death to myself
Between the flesh and the void,
No coming back, exit the soul
Imprisoned remain,
Between the flesh and the void.
I am the one spreading plague and disease
God cannot hear you, he is deaf to your pleas
Holy despair, overthrowing the lord
One with the devil all faith is destroyed
The end has begun, behold thy name
Defacing their idols and breaking their laws
Murdering Christ as I cripple the cross
No resurrection, dethroned Nazarene
Prayers go unanswered, succumb to defeat
Fallen from grace, bring an end to all things
Heavens disciples will fall to my rage
Devoured by faith, the illusion of god
Crucify Christ to the unholy one
The end has begun, behold thy name
Death to your god, the end has begun
The savior descend, divine suffering,
Invite the unknown despised and dethroned,
to fold in defeat, even the gods can bleed
The end has begun, behold thy name
Repent unto thee, even the gods can bleed
I am the one spreading plague and disease
God cannot hear you, he is deaf to your pleas
Holy despair, overthrowing the lord
One with the devil all faith is destroyed
Question the lord with a heart full of hate,
Speaking in tongues and fulfilling his faith,
Walking through fire alone and displaced,
All who defile the lord and his name...
Blasphemy unto thee, conquer all things,
Battered and beaten the cross of mystique,
Papal in ruin and brought to its knees,
See through religion and you will find peace...
Damning the souls of his praise, rapture begotten ill gain,
Crossing the light from divine, death to your god and his kind.
Bury the book in its grave, holy of holy's in flames
Worn and despised and diseased, trample the cross in defeat.
Darkness and evil and unholy dreams,
go without mention and cannot be seen,
Do not assume what you don't want to know,
Christ and religion is only for show...
Fear has deflowered the lies of his faith,
Watching it die puts a smile on my face,
Holy ground crumble from under their feet,
Once and forever and ever shall be...
Life of disgust, his fable you trust, a fool, you abide,
Hailing his vengeance and stripped of all senses, for god... you die,
Fallen to silence
Death and defiance
Destroying the feeble
Banished by evil
Defraud the meek their followers weak, and cower at his sign,
Truth of contention, deceit with intention, the heart, of the blind
Revival and crosses at one with your losses, and wonder, his lie
Unright with the facts, and there's no coming back, the light, denied
Fallen to silence
Death and defiance
Destroying the feeble
Banished by evil
Soul is consumed, the coming of doom, the bible you revive,
Blasphemy blessing, is faint and distressing, his words of Christ.
Blind to our death your creation a mess, prayers for your need are denied, blind to despair and your lord does not care, watching this world as it dies
Lack of reflection, with no interaction, the world will die,
You're only a ghost and refuse to invoke, the power of your Christ...
Fallen to silence
Death and defiance
Destroying the feeble
Banished by evil
Death to religion, a blind contradiction of life defied,
The cross of deception and book of infection the truth a lie.
Death unfold, bleeding from my eyes,
Damn this soul, to the other side,
Conscious of sin, from this hell we're in,
Done with this life, brought here just to die,
Kill the light of Christ, truth is ours to find,
Trapped inside this shrine, all that lives will die
Grace of god, drowning in my blood,
All behold, kill us one by one
Anger betray, stifled and deceived, want of the lord, that we will believe...
Kill the light of christ, truth is ours to find
Trapped inside this shrine, flawed in his design,
Waiting till my time, all that lives will die
At the end of hope and loss the body will decease, destiny
Promising the afterlife to ease our suffering, suffering
Step into the outer reaches of the great unknown, all will die
Defect and deficient is the image of the lord...the lord
Kill the light of christ, truth is ours to find,
Trapped inside this shrine, all that lives will die,
Left untold, to suffice his lie,
Spirit world, where we cross that line,
When it begins, will we live again,
Mired in death, into the abyss
Kill the light of christ, truth is ours to find,
Trapped inside this shrine, flawed in his design,
No one will survive, all that lives will die
From the creation and beginning of man
With no explanation to his biblical plan
No longer needed for your god to exist
The call of temptation that no one can resist
Nullify resistance to control our lives
Sterilized creation, born to bear your lie
Mortified in madness by a man made god
The solitude of sadness the father and the son
End the wrath of god, End the wrath of god
There have been no prophets that speak the word of god
There is no salvation, delusions from above
Book of contradiction, the one that I despise
In the words of truth I speak, the lords of lords will die...
End the wrath of god...
Nullify resistance to control our lives
Sterilized creation, born to bear your lie
Mortified in madness by a man made god
The solitude of sadness the father and the son
Book of contradiction, the one that I despise
In the words of truth I speak, the lords of lords will die...
End the wrath of god, End the wrath of god
Book of contradiction, the one that I despise
In the words of truth I speak, the lords of lords will die...
Flat line, the gruesome possession,
the pounding of negative energy,
the astral body is ripped from the obsession,
to merge with the infinity.
Besieged with the negative,
no longer safe from the spirit world.
The lower layers of the real,
is infested with the liar,
anti organic entities feel
weak emotional scars to enter with fire.
Loosing all human perspective,
the ego conscious is swirled.
The haunting of the flesh,
to dissolve the soul they strive,
and jealously detest,
the dimension that is earthly life.

The haunting of the flesh,

This intense feeling of not being,
has taken the soul into a dissonance,
when the inner core is not seeing,
and cannot find any anchors of relevance.
The transition of life into the next,
can sometimes be so surreal,
mental protection now is in effect,
to preserve the soul from the feel.
Amongst the spirit worlds and deities,
you will have to find your place,
eternities of wisdom and prophecies,
mental projection at your own pace.
The transition of life into the next,
can sometimes be so surreal,
mental protection now is in effect,

Repeated psychosis,
inside the darkened void.
Demonic hypnosis,
human intellect destroyed.

The virgin soul no longer white,
shining devious through the skin,
the body's aura losing it's bright,
mental projection of the sin.
[Solo Mameli]
The sicker the body and soul,
the more negative the aura gets,
blacker than the blackest coal,
revealing the negative that affects.
The aura cannot lie and hide,
this true entity that is so grim,
egoism overshadows all pride,
chance of mental recovery is slim.
The sicker the body and soul,
the more negative the aura gets,
blacker than the blackest coal,

Ego no longer separated from lies,
so the conscious cannot see,
the truth is smothered and dies,
trapped in structure and no longer free.
[Solo Uterwijk]
The test of time already lost,
Once reborn destined to morph,
Trying to live at all cost,
Death is eminent to absorb.
The transition to the all is inevitable,
Living death as we breathe,
Mind's capacity makes it comfortable,
Suppressing the horrors underneath.
Just let go the feeling of helplessness,
Can't do shit about this pure sickness,
That is called life.
This sick and tragic life,
It will soon be realized. 
Necromorph.
Mangled and ripped from existence,
gateway to the unknown compels,
maintaining the ego is subsistence,
spirit guides restrain the soul to dwell.
Escaping destiny is not an option,
to face your reincarnations and fear,
tearing the layers for absorption,
salvation from denial is more than near.
The physical nightmare has begun,
separation of the flesh and the soul,
the mind cannot cope and goes into a mental stun,
before acceptable to achieves the astral goal.
Laniatus-ripping the soul from the flesh.

Mangled and ripped from existence,

After fading into nothing less,
the aging soul falls into distress,
the immense emotion of being bodiless,
pushes your awareness to psycho stress.
Left in the cold of the emptiness,
never dying is reality,
I call upon the creator with many faces,
for salvation from this insanity.
The great strings of awareness,
create the boundaries of the all,
the spheres of consciousness,
keeping out daemons with this wall.
Entities familiar and unknown,
speak in tongue to doubt,
the earthly now overthrown,
to test the soul of it's devout.
Distress—ultradaemons want my soul.
Distress—take my astral to control.
[Solo Uterwijk]
The nonphysical guides try to protect,
from the lower entities,
for us to deny and reject,
to fulfill our faith and responsibilities.
[Solo Mameli]
Beware of the rotting of the soul,
no one can escape this horrible destiny,
karma will have the life energy turn cold,
the all black creeps upon the human identity.
To slowly consume the saved acceptability,
servants of hate devour with precision,
the bodiless being's credibility,
without the need of an incision.
This process is executed on a higher plane,
when the truth is being exposed,
the burning makes you go insane,
and the eaten parts of the soul disposed.
Soulrot—haunting the feeble soul, soulrot.
Soulrot—watch destiny unfold, soulrot.

Purified once more from the negative,
the eternal cycle of existence,
extracted, the lurking sedative,
manifesting on your resistance.
To slowly consume the saved acceptability,
servants of hate devour with precision,
the bodiless being's credibility,
without the need of an incision.
Flooded with the energy of a thousand souls,
chaos merging with the timeless,
the all knowing controls,
the infestation of the heartless.
Blackened entities merge with the already fallen,
as the catastrophic scenario unfolds.

Hopelessly trapped inside the multiple sphere,
all reincarnations are now one,
becoming multiple beings,
full of fear.
Blackened entities merge with the already fallen,

[Solo Uterwijk]
The never ending stream of the sick,
drenched and saturated with hate,
overshadows natural transitions that are basic,
fucking up the holy just to complicate.
Letting go past emotions and embracing the new,
the easier it gets to detach from our loved ones,
this natural evolution disrupts for but a few,
hooked on the earthly shall make you not gone.
The realization that body and soul can be separated,
will make one understand the true nature of reality.
We are not just flesh but more than that incorporated.

Transition—letting go and leaving behind.
Transition—evolving into the next kind.
Clear voidance in a lucid state of mind,
no need for eyes just intuition,
leaving all earthly worries behind,
systematic patterns create the decision.
Pain of a thousand life's are now one,
mental journey to the inner core,
physical pain long time gone,
non existence after and before.
Connecting to the all knowing source,
information of all mysteries revealed,
a fraction of eternity births your course,
faith of a next life is sealed.

The purpose of existence falls into place,
to live in sickness and in death,
to die useless and fall from grace,
and suffer the healing from regrets.

Come… Come to me, everlasting fire
Lift me up and bring me higher power
To kill the tyrants, to kill the born in chaos
Avenge the living with all distinctive force
Come… Come to me, everlasting fire
Engulf my soul, engulf my every desire
To kill the tyrants, to kill the born in chaos
Avenge the dead with all distinctive force
Hear my calling, feel my wrath, like a crow a swarm,
Through the dark I roam, in this castle, the vision of the dead
No justice, no reason
No freedom, no wrath
No truth, no will
Nowhere to run
I summon thee, oh… great fire
To bring eternal devastation
Witness sorrow, waters drenched in black, cities in ruins, angels falling…
Open the gates of hell, crush the enemies below, let your demons flow…
Come… FIRE!
No justice, no reason
No freedom, no wrath
No truth, no will
Nowhere to run
I summon thee, oh… great fire
To bring eternal devastation
Come… come to me, everlasting fire
Lift me up and bring me higher power
To kill the tyrants, to kill the born in chaos
Avenge the living with all distinctive force
Come… Come to me, everlasting fire
Engulf my soul, engulf my every desire
To kill the tyrants, to kill the born in chaos
Avenge the dead with all distinctive force
FIRE!
Enter your mind
Enter your soul
Search the seeds of contemplation, this is your life but this is my world
Hence the end of your god
Let the voice of freedom reign again
Fanatic rage that rots core, entitled children above the law
Political ambush to serve the elite, no one is free to believe
Enslaved to profit a world in ruins, distant visions of dying era
Scratching the surface determined to stay alive
No more fucking lies!
If I was god… I’d burn it all I’d take it to the ground and light it up, light up
If you don’t care, why should I? Set this world on fire
All you believe is a world of illusions
All you believe is a lie, nothing is left, nothing is real, engaged and ready to kill
As sentenced to live is as sentenced to die
Search for answers above the skies, this is your life but this is my world
Hence… the end of your god
Let the voice of freedom reign again
No more fucking lies!
If I was god… I’d burn it all, I’d take it to the ground and light it up, light up
If you don’t care, why should I? Set this world on fire
Inch by inch, step by step, with all my heart I’ll burn this fucker down!
It lives inside, the seed of life
Ripped apart, silenced
Broken and demolished
Crippled emotions feed existence
Ripped apart, silenced
Broken and demolished
Animals
Just like animals
We live and die
We multiply
The thirst of blood keeps us alive
Just like animals
We live to dominate, we need the urge to kill, we are the victims, we are the prey
You can’t change who you are
Your primitive ways will always prevail
The need to conquer, the need to be incomplete
Rise above the waters, just to drown and suffer, just to feel alive
There’s no escape from life, who we are is endless… until we die again
Just like animals
We live and die
We multiply
The thirst of blood keeps us alive
Just like animals
We live to dominate, we need the urge to kill, we are the victims, we are the prey
You can’t kill who you are
You’re an animal
The earth is venomous, all shall die under one mind
Their souls are treacherous, crush the weak under one sign
Release your anger, they command under your cries
Obey your master, enslaved to die under red skies
The blind lead the blind, eternal darkness
The poor eat the poor, forevermore
The rich eat it all, they want it all
We are sentenced to fail
Break through the circle of trust that leads to nowhere
There’s no way out of here, the blood they spill is gone forever
Kill the elite
Darkness falls upon us
Kill the elite
We are the light of rebellion
The end of your greed, the end of your control
These chains will break, unleash the beast of humanity
Set me free
Look into these eyes
What you see is real
It’s the last thing you’ll ever see
Kill the elite
Darkness falls upon us
Kill the elite
We are the light of rebellion
Ride the strains of your life into despair
Hide most of your thoughts into a stare
The reason of endless struggle is imperfection
Pressure me, seize my strength, paralyze my soul for you
Lay hopeless like a sheep led to slaughter
Like a wolf I howl under lawless skies
The weight of all of your fears, burns in the air you breathe
The glory of all your past shattered in vein, eternal
Plunge into a sea of madness, I can smell your existence rotting away
Lay hopeless like a sheep led to slaughter
Like a wolf I howl under lawless skies
Visions of chaos inhabit our lives, no truth in a world of lies
The parallels of sanity, border the insane
Time is endless, pain is faithless
A mirror of broken dreams our souls remembered
Life, death, we’re dead and buried
When all is gone our souls will turn to dust
Six feet below, you’ll find salvation forever
Time is endless, pain is faithless
A mirror of broken dreams our souls remembered
Life, death, we’re dead and buried
When all is gone our souls will turn to dust
Life, death, we’re dead and buried
When all is gone we fade into the sun
Dead and buried
Hold on to nothing, fall in disgrace
There’s no one here, to cradle your fate
We are nothing, but shadows and dust, save me…
Life, death, we’re dead and buried
When all is gone our souls will turn to dust
Life, death, we’re dead and buried
When all is gone we fade into the sun
Under a shade of darkness I rise
I’ll show you things like you’ve never seen before
I am the reaper of death, I am the savior of man
No, I never wanted for my life to be so meaningless
Hate is so steady, so steady in my veins
This rage just keeps growing inside
It’s getting harder to kill, it’s getting harder to live
Sleep… In the darkest days of slumber
Wait… For the end to come
Pray for all the blood to spill
It’s getting harder to breathe
It’s getting harder to die
Sinners were all the same in the grips of death
You walk on water, I drown in darkness
Sleep… In the darkest days of slumber
Wait… For the end to come
Lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, pride
It’s the way I live
From the day I was born nothing was given
I used to bleed just to feel alive
All I wanted was to reach the sky
They tried to kill my soul and bury my mind
There is no god here
These fists are made of blood
It feels like walking through broken glass
Every time I take a step, inside your temple of lies
Rise, rise, rise from all your sickness
This blood is real, these scars run deep, it’s death before dishonor
This blood is real, these scars run deep, it’s death before dishonor
It’s a sign inside us, that shelters emotions, defies oppression
From the day I was born nothing was given
I used to bleed just to feel alive
All I wanted was to reach the sky
They tried to kill my soul and bury my mind
Real blood, real scars, real life
It’s a world of confusion, everything you see is an illusion
There’s no way to choose right from wrong
Everyone’s opinion is pointless
Everyone’s judgement is useless
Your days are numbered, your faith destruction
I don’t want your poison to linger in my veins
Feel the anger within, from an ocean of hate
It’s a promise in blood, walk away
It’s a promise in blood, promise in blood!
Defy, let the world strike you down
Defy, take a step back, let the world strike you down
It’s a brink of disaster run away, pull the plug and throw it all away
Let it go, puppet master… I am king and you are my slave
I don’t want your poison, to linger in my veins
Feel the anger within, from an ocean of hate
It’s a promise in blood… walk away
It’s a promise in blood… promise in blood!
It’s a promise in blood
Dissecting the shrine, ensuring your rise
Oppressing the masses, unleashing the chaos
Hold it down, vengeance is swift for the dying
They infiltrate the laws, to rage a war of control
Kneel, arrogance, it’s your time to die
In your empire of dirt, behead the king of nothing
Crawl through everything
The symbols of your faith
Betray your very existence
As the innocent bathe in blood, in blood
It’s your time to die
In your empire of dirt, behead the king of nothing
Kneel, arrogance, it’s your time to die
In your empire of dirt, behead the king of nothing
Shades of black engulf the skies
Death calls all the dead to rise
See the pestilence walk the earth
Hear the screams, covered in darkness
Look down at the world below, entrenched is a sea of sorrow
Come forth, unholy one
As death comes to us all
Elevate
I won’t let you take me away, I won’t let you drag me down, are you here for me?
Because I’m already dead
I’m the lion
I’m the fire
I’m the strength that binds us all
I’m the hope that fears us all
Is this everything you wanted?
Misery from a cold embrace
Shattered dreams of a past erased
Senseless rage of the failures obtained
Breaking point of all the blood you drained
My pain, your savior
As death comes to us all
Elevate
I won’t let you take me away
I won’t let you drag me down, are you here for me?
Because I’m already dead
Elevate me

Truth and honor, faith and pride
All convictions surely died
Honesty's time has passed
Time for lies is here at last
Truth is false, I'm so fed up
How did we come to be so fucked
Hate, fear, pain, death
All our country has got left
Talk to children hear them say
Daddy left again today
Brother steals and mommy lies
Future lost before their eyes
The sun was lost behind the clouds
They rapped it up and blacked it out
Acid rain fell today
It came and washed our hopes away
This was once the land of dreams
Now these dreams have turned to greed
In the midst of all this wealth
The poor are left to help themselves
A capitalist's democracy
Why no one said that freedom's free
Lady liberty rots away
No truth, no justice, the American way
Don't look past your TV
All of us are what you see
A looking glass into our lives
What we watch is what we buy
Priorities are out of whack
Who is next to stab our back
Doesn't it make you mad
To have lost all that we've had
This was once the land of dreams
Now these dreams have turned to greed
In the midst of all this wealth
The poor are left to help themselves
A capitalist's democracy
Why no one said that freedom's free
Lady liberty rots away
No truth, no justice, the American way
Doesn't it fill you with disgust
That there's no one left to trust
Is this happening, is this real
My body numb, I cannot feel
Are you happy? Are you sad?
Are emotions a thing of the past
I have no tears, I cannot cry
No one mourns for a world that's died
This was once the land of dreams
Now these dreams have turned to greed
In the midst of all this wealth
The poor are left to help themselves
A capitalist's democracy
Why no one said that freedom's free
Lady liberty rots away
No truth, no justice, the American way
Engines are running our blood burns like oil.
Head one by one down the highway
Tires are screaming leave trails on the road, the sirens of death coming our way
We'll always be one step ahead, we'll not fall back
Pedal to metal rock hard and ride free, the philosophy of a rider
Don't use the brakes ride on faster instead, adrenaline taking you higher
Fall back in line or stand away, we like it fast
Into hell we ride fast as lightning, enter the darkness
The weak ones will pay
Ride through fire cause revolution, this is a hellrider's way
Crushing the traitors to no man we kneel, the power is at our command
Nothing can stop us it's head over heel, united together we stand
If it's to hard then you're too weak, you're in our way
If you ain't tough enough to play, get out our way
Hear the rolling sound of thunder
As the battle rages on
We will tear this world us under
Feel our power
Through a darkened sky we riding
Pierce the night with bolts of light
We will find you although you are hiding
Under cover
We will break through with
Thunder and fire
Realising an unholy
Hellborn, desire
We are out of control
To conquer this world
From a world you broken into
From a world unknown to man
We release our wrath upon you
Holy bloodshed
Breaking chains of your religion
Worship none or be destroyed
You cannot defeat our legion
Bleed the world red
We will break through with
Thunder and fire
Realising an unholy
Hellborn, desire
We are out of control
To conquer this world
Lightning bolts of anger
Raging in your world
We uphold the darkness
Rulers of the moonlight
As you think its over
Calm has settled in
Thundergods returning
Back to rule this planet again
Future role of generations
Let us rage into this world
They'll be trusting our patience
Run for cover
Hear the rolling sound of thunder
As the battle rages on
We will tear this world us under
Feel our power
We live for the magic in the sound, distorted guitars are breaking ground
The drum pounding faster than my heart, the vocals are screaming extreme art
The passion for metal drives us forth, the best heavy metal comes from north
The powerful tunes, spectacular shows, the audience screams in ecstasy
Metal, Metal
Back with the vengeance
Metal, Metal
All that I need is heavy metal
Metal
Screaming together
Metal, Metal
Metal is all that I need
While hell bends for leather we stand strong, a rocker can party all night long
the school couldn't teach us rock' n roll, the school couldn't help us reach our goal
We live for the magic in the sound, distorted guitars are breaking ground
The powerful tunes, spectacular shows, the audience screams in ecstasy
Facing the wind as they ride through the sky
Shadows of Mordor black horses they fly
Black shadow king, find the ring.
Search for the Halfling you lords of the dark
The hobbit with Sauron's ring he is your mark
Unholy light, in the night
Black knights of Sauron
You're made of iron
Black shadows of Mordor
Wield one-eyed shields
Unholy ring wraiths with armour of steel
Kings of the past to no one you kneel
Hearts filled with hate, that's your fate.
Facing the wind as they ride through the sky
Shadows of Mordor black horses they fly
Ride shadow king, find the ring.
No use to pray, there's no one listening
I will die anyway.
Some say I've killed, some call me Satan
Now my blood must be spilled
I'm sentenced for crimes I did not commit
I'll pay with my blood, is this really it?
Creations of God?
No way!
Burn your crosses, make way for science
Christ has only caused death and violence
Burn your crosses and make way for yourself
Put faith in mother earth.
Don't call his name, don't trust in others
Bishops fighting for fame.
Torture in vain. I won't surrender
Purified by pain.
Mankind's great mistake was to create God
Creation of man. Excuse to spill blood.
Creations of God?
No way!
No use to pray, there's no one listening
I will die anyway.
Leaving this place the end is near now
Dying ain't no disgrace
My last night alive has come to an end
Death once I feared, but now it's my friend.
Creation of God?
No way!
Burned my crosses, make way for science
Christ will only cause death and violence
Burned my crosses and made way for myself
In mother earth I trust.
NOW BURN!
The dawn of time breaks
See the sun rise to the sky
The wheel of time begins to turn
But then we heard it
A divine voice out of nowhere
Spoke to our hearts and showed the way
Almighty lord we have come to your hall
Do glatem live, creator of all
Open your heart and you will find a way
Paradise calling and enter you may
Falling down
Now your soul returns to paradise
The wheel kept turning, ages came
Time passed us by
We lived in perfect harmony
But then it happened
Our ranks decreased rapidly
But now its time for our return
Once we were numerous
But that's long ago
Clouds are gathering in the darkness.
Lightning strikes the Earth.
Evil forces celebrate, Lucifer's rebirth
Necromancers, sacrifices, he'll be here for sure.
Drained blood from a thousand men, and now he's back for more.
He will rise from a world down under
Bringing fire, plague, death and thunder
Summons creatures unknown to mankind
Demons of the past
Unholy rites. Assassins from hell
Cold endless nights upon us fell
The storm strikes our land with madness and pain
Winds of the damned drives us insane
Satan's hordes are coming closer, now it's time to pay
Riding on the wings of death searching for their prey
Now the time has come for mankind to prove strong or fall
Fighting against unholy creatures spawned in Satan's hall
Trapped in hellfire he was burned
Once locked up but the wind has turned
Seeking vengeance in pain and slaughter
Back on earth again
Demons marked with the five-edged star
Haunt our dreams in this endless war
Killing children and raping women
Now it's time to die
Once we lived in harmony, but it seems so distance now.
Even though it wasn't long ago, were all doomed to plague and death.
Working hard from dawn 'til dusk.
But that ain't enough for him
Product of unholy love, untrue brother of a king.
Know that you'll fail, now hear us hail
Your brother that you killed.
Hail to the king that brought peace to us all.
Rise from your grave, hear our call.
We'll not forget that you once saved our land.
Killed by your own brothers hand.
Pure evil and cruelty, the true nature of your soul
Mercy and responsibility, words that you can't understand.
Your quest for total control will only end in your own fall.
We' will fight for our freedom, and our right to live.
Do it your way, soon you will pay
Debts with your own blood.
Stars so bright, dance in the night
Day come soon, hide the moon
Stars so bright dance in the night
Day come soon, killing the moon
Morning breaks it's time to march, to the castle of betrayal.
Bring your sword, wield your armour, we won't take this anymore.
Kill the tyrant he must die, for his falseness and his crimes.
Strike him down, and slay his guards, and his ministers as well.
Done it your way, now you will pay
Debts with your own blood.
Crack in the distance, a flash in the sky
It's getting dark, clouds gather power
You heard it coming from over the hill
It's time to run, time to seek cover.
Now there is no hideaway
And you have no chance
Thor and his hammer are riding his chariots of storm
Breaking the silence with powerful roars
Wind gaining strength, screaming tornado
First wave is over, don't hold back your breath
It sure coming back, second attack
Now there is no hideaway
And you have no chance
The sky is on fire the heavens are burning in flames
THUNDER
THUNDER
STRIKING
THUNDER
A cold rain is falling, a lightning strikes down
Distance is dark, horizon is frightening
Massive strong lightning's are shaking the ground
Thor is upset, out slaying giants
Now there is no hideaway
And you have no chance
Thor and his hammer are out slaying giants tonight.
Born with a heart of a lion, raving to space on your own.
Into the belt of Orion, g-forces bite to the bone
Speed makes your heart burn like fire
Speed makes your heart burn with lust
Challenges taking you higher
Ride fast and do what you want
Fast as the lightning, your life is at stake
You're the one that
Speeder, Speeder
Faster and higher, exciting desire.
Speeder, Speeder
G-forces bite to the bone
Out of this world you are racing
Into an asteroid belt
Challenges of death you are facing
Strongest kick you ever felt
Faster than light, ride through the night
No way to stop this machine
Asses have turned never return
Search for the world of your dream
We're a small crowd left to rotten, there's not many hard souls left
As the pop is growing stronger, will metal fade away?
Will we be broken, will we go down?
No! We'll never fall we're the masters of the world
Get up let's break those chains now and party all night long
No! We'll never fall we're the masters of the world
Get up let's break those chains now and party all night long
As I'm tweaking with my radio, there's disco everywhere
When I turn on my big TV, is hip hop what I want to see?
Have we been broken, did we go down?
[bonus track: Judas Priest Cover]
Deadly as the viper
Peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb
The fuse is running short
on the verge of snapping if it's caught
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode -- Jawbreaker
Crouching in the corner
Wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted
Claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode -- Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker...
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode -- Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker...
Enemy - Show me what you wanna be 
I can handle anything 
Even if I can't handle you 
Readily - Either way it better be 
Don't you fuckin' pity me 
Get up, get off... 
What the hell am I sayin'? 
I don't know about malevolent 
Sure as hell decadent 
I want somebody to step up, step off 
Walls! Let me fall! Fuck you all! 
Get a grip, don't let me slip 'til I drop the ball 
I - I want it all! 
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it 
You're goin' down, this is a war! 
Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind? 
You're leavin' me suspect, I'm leavin' you grotesque 
Feels like a burn from which you never learn 
Cause and effect, you jealous ass 
Press your face against the glass - suffer 
I want it all! 
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it 
You're goin' down, this is a war! 
I've just begun 
It's about that time 
Gotta get mine 
You can't kill me 
Cuz I'm already inside you 
Sick
Insane - Am I the only muthafucker with a brain? 
I'm hearing voices but all they do is complain 
How many times have you wanted to kill 
Everything and everyone - Say you'll do it but never will 
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 
I am my Father's son 
He's a phantom, a mystery and that leaves me 
Nothing! 
How many times have you wanted to die? 
It's too late for me. All you have to do is get rid of me! 
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 
It's all in your head 
It's all in my head 
It's all in your head 
I tried - You lied to me for so long 
Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it 
Freak on my antics and give me a choice 
Doesn't matter if I give a shit 
It's shit that you gave me 
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 
It's all in your head 
It's all in my head 
It's all in your head 
Do you wanna feel pain? Takin' my name in vain 
Caring never felt so lame inside 
Anybody else got pride? Do you wanna take my life? 
Maybe I'll reverse my ride 
Who the hell are you? Fuck you! 
Better suck it up cuz you bled through 
Better get away from me 
Stay the fuck away from me! 
I feel safe - Seems your saved 
Look me in my brand new eye
I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander over where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 
Goodbye! 
I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time 
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up 
This is not the way I pictured me 
I can't control my shakes 
How the hell did I get here? 
Something about this, so very wrong... 
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this 
Is it a dream or a memory? 
I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander over where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 
Get outta my head cuz I don't need this 
Why I didn't I see this? 
I'm a victim - Manchurian candidate 
I have sinned by just 
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away 
I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander over where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 
Goodbye! 
You haven't learned a thing 
I haven't changed a thing 
My flesh was in my bones 
The pain was always free 
I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander out where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 
And it waits for you!
Running out of ways to run 
I can't see, I can't be 
Over and over and under my skin 
All this attention is doing me in! 
Fuck it all! Fuck this world! 
Fuck everything that you stand for! 
Don't belong! Don't exist! 
Don't give a shit! 
Don't ever judge me! 
Picking through the parts exposed 
Taking shape, taking shag 
Over and over and under my skin 
All this momentum is doing me in! 
Fuck it all! Fuck this world! 
Fuck everything that you stand for! 
Don't belong! Don't exist! 
Don't give a shit! 
Don't ever judge me! 
You got all my love, livin' in your own hate 
Drippin' hole man, hard step, no fate 
Show you nuthin', but I ain't holdin' back 
Every damn word I say is a sneak attack 
When I get my hands on you 
Ain't a fuck thing you can do 
Get this cuz you're never gonna get me 
I am the very disease you pretend to be 
I am the push that makes you move
Since you never gave a damn in the first place 
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned 
Cuz in the interest of all involved I got the problem solved 
And the verdict is guilty... 
...Man nearly killed me 
Steppin' where you fear to tread 
Stop, drop and roll - you were dead from the git-go!! 
Big mouth fucker, stupid cocksucker! 
Are you scared of me now? Then you're dumber than I thought 
Always is, never was 
Foundation made of piss and vinegar 
Step to me, I'll smear ya - Think I fear ya? bullshit! 
Just another dumb punk chompin' at this tit 
Is there any way to break through the noise? 
Was it something that I said that got you bent? 
It's gotta be that way if you want it 
Sanity, Literal Profanity hit me! 
Spit it out 
All you wanna do is drag me down 
All I wanna do is stamp you out 
Maybe it's the way you spread a lotta rumour fodder 
Keepin' all your little spies and leavin' when you realise 
Step up, fairy 
I guess it's time to bury your ass with the chrome 
Straight to the dome 
You heard that right, bitch, I didn't stutter 
If you know what's good - sit, shut up and beg, brother 
Backstab - Don't you know who you're dissin'? 
Side swipe - we know the ass that you're kissin'! 
Bigidy - bigidy bitch boy, halfwat hauser 
Can't hear shit cuz I keep gettin' louder 
Step up, and you get a face full o' tactic 
Lippin' off hard, goin' home in a basket 
You got no pull, no power, no nuthin' 
Now you start shit? Well, ain't that somethin'? 
Payoffs don't protect, and you can't hide if you want 
But I'll find you - Comin' up behind you! 
Spit it out 
All you wanna do is drag me down 
All I wanna do is stamp you out 
'Bout time I set this record straight 
All the needlenose punchin' is makin' me irate 
Sick o' my bitchin' fallin' on deaf ears 
Where YOU gonna be in the next five years? 
The crew and all the fools, and all the politix 
Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick 
You got dick when they passed out the good stuff 
Bam 
Are you sick of me? Good enough - had enough 
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies! 
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemas! 
Spit it out 
All you wanna do is drag me down 
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Kill Me
(Tattered and torn)
Something aches
(Tattered and torn)
Bad things slither
(Tattered and torn)
My floors are burning down
(Tattered and torn)
And I can't find a window
(Tattered and torn)
This is medieval
(Tattered and torn)
This is cerebral
(Tattered and torn)
Suffocated
(Tattered and torn)
Melodramatic
(Tattered and torn)
Driven to the verge of
(Tattered and torn)
I make you my enemy
(Tattered and torn)
The nerves you sever
(Tattered and torn)
Can serve you better
(Tattered and torn)
In the blink of an eye
(Tattered and torn)
In the space of a second
(Tattered and torn)
Open my wrists
(Tattered and torn)
Give me my lessons
(Tearing myself apart)
From the things that make me hurt
She lay as though she were in a trance, 
With her long eyelashes fluttering like she was dreaming. 
She said to him "I lie beyond the sea", 
And then all of a sudden her head dipped back and she vanished. 
Gone, gone without a trace. 
Gone. 
She's never coming back, do you know what it's like to live with that? 
No one knows what it's like. 
The only one who knew me, gone."
Maze...psychopathic daze...I create this waste 
Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic 
ways...can't escape this place...I deny your face 
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying 
Put me in a homemade cellar 
Put me in a hole for shelter 
Someone hear me please, all I see is hate 
I can hardly breathe, and I can hardly take it 
HANDSONMYFACEOVERBEARINGICAN'TGETOUT 
Lost...ran at my own cost...hearing laughter, scoffed 
Learning from the rush, detached from such and such 
Bleak...all around me, weak...listening, incomplete 
I am not a dog, but I'm the one your dogging 
I am in a buried kennel 
I have never felt so final 
Someone find me please, losing all reserve 
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying 
You all stare, but you'll never see 
There is something inside me 
There is something in you I despise 
Cut me - show me - enter - I am 
willing and able and never any danger to myself 
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain 
Or was my tolerance a phase? 
Empathy, out of my way 
I can't die 
Purity
Liberate - My madness 
(One of me, all of you) 
Liberate - My madness 
I just want to... 
Section off myself 
Put a wall up/What the hell have I done 
Keep the dog at bay 
Survive by saving me! 
Values and the game 
Not a fuck-up - Not a part of your lie 
I am one, I am all - I'm above and beyond! 
Back off of the shit 
Stand off or I'll spit 
So soft, you forget 
Your garbage in is garbage out 
You don't give a shit 
I won't play the fit 
Get off, get on this 
Your garbage in is garbage out 
Liberate my madness... 
Liberate - My madness 
(One of me, all of you) 
Liberate - My madness 
I just want to... 
I am not ashamed 
What is vital, isn't always humane 
You can break in vain 
But you can't break away 
Even in my face 
Lotta bullshit, not alotta the truth 
I can't see from here 
But I can smell your fear 
Back off of the shit 
Stand off or I'll spit 
So soft, you forget 
Your garbage in is garbage out 
You don't give a shit 
I won't play the fit 
Get off, get on this 
Your garbage in is garbage out 
Saved - You're such a slave - I don't expect a 
Name - You don't care - I wasn't witness - 
I can't be a part of a system such as this 
Hard eyes - Glow right - In my - Darkness - Again 
With the sickness, rengade blisters, sisters, 
Salivate, litigate, liberate, madness, sadness 
Fuck this - How long have I had this? 
I don't need this - Outta my business 
Insert, engage, betrayed, my God 
Fraud 
Liberate - My madness 
(One of me, all of you) 
Liberate - My madness 
I just want to...
Even if you run... I will find you 
I decided I wanted you 
Now I know...I need 
If you can't be bought, tougher than I thought 
Keep in mind - I am with you 
Never left out fate, can't concentrate 
You will be mine! 
Ah, fucking you will be mine! 
Ah, fucking you will be mine! 
Ah, fucking you will be mine! 
I found you 
Leanin' out of an open window 
You laughed (my fingers clenched) 
Too perfect, far too careless 
I couldn't help myself - I just took you 
Dammit man I knew it was a mistake 
(You brought it outta me) 
Better make yourself out home 
You're here to stay 
You won't bother me...If you let me bother you 
All the doors are locked, all the windows shut 
Keep in mind - I watch you 
Never leave my side, never leave me, fucker 
Even if you run 
What the fuck is different? Man, I can't believe I'm doin' this 
Dammit man I knew it was a mistake 
(You brought it outta me)
My freedom is best 
Whole country's on house arrest 
And everyone's a suspect 
You can't feel the flow because you died 
Face down on a "suicide" 
The muthafucker's on self-destruct 
Nobody guardin' your back, it's all a front 
Save this! My rage is bliss! 
I'm takin' names and gettin' pissed! 
Where's Chuck D when ya need him? 
You ain't shit, just a puddle on the 
Bed spread 
The maniac psycho 
Cool j screamed the shit 
But I still can't believe it 
Man, it's funny that you scare me so 
Just enough to fuck me up again and again 
Hard life is hard as hell 
Better back the fuck on up 
Cuz this is... 
No kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(I've got to get out!) 
It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(You can't blame me!) 
Can't be real no more - Your mask is skin and bone 
Savor every flavor you want cuz it's not your own 
Bad-ass at bat, man 
Forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win 
Breathe! Amer-cult, Breathe! On more - Seethe! 
Freak like you gotta pair 
Won't be my fault 
When you're painted in the corner of a no-good life 
This is... 
No kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(I've got to get out!) 
It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(You can't blame me!) 
I can't remember, I don't understand, 
Is it malice that makes you this way? 
Carry it with you 'til someone forgives you 
I laugh cuz there's nothing to say 
You can't begin to consider the 
Palpable hate in the air when you're here 
None of us wonder what weather you're under 
You're making it perfectly clear! 
Lights ain't on - shit ain't right 
Never had peace so I had to fight 
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against 
The wall, slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me 
You're all reality and sound bites 
And the freedom is never in plain sight 
The feelings, the question, the price is too 
Human, for fucking sake - This is... 
No kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(I've got to get out!) 
It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(You can't blame me!)
I'm cold, I'm ugly 
I'm always confused by everything 
I can stare into a thousand eyes 
But every smile hides a bold-faced lie 
It itches, it seethes, it festers and breathes 
My heros are dead, they died in my head 
Thin out the herd, squeeze out the pain 
Something inside me has opened up again 
Thoughts of me exemplified 
All the little flaws I have denied 
Forget today, forget whatever happened 
Everyday I see a little more of overall deficiencies 
I'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe 
What the hell - did I - do to deserve - all of this? 
I save all the bullets from ignorant minds 
Your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind 
Way past good taste, on our way to bad omens 
I decrease, while my symptoms increase 
God what the fuck is wrong 
You act like you knew it all along 
Your timing sucks, your silence is a blessing 
All I ever wanted out of you was 
Something you could never be 
Now take a real good look at 
What you've fucking done to me 
What the hell - did I - do to deserve - all of this? 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you, boy 
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you, bitch 
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up 
I see you in me 
I keep my scars from prying eyes 
Incapable of ever knowing why 
Somebody breathe, I've got to have an answer 
Why am I so fascinated by 
Bigger pictures, better things 
But I don't care what you think 
You'll never understand me 
What the hell - did I - do to deserve - all of this? 
Fuck!
Pain - made to order
I'm not the second coming, I'm the first wave
Better get an army, cuz the fire left me unscathed
You betcha bottom dollar I'm the top of the shit pile
So stick around cuz I'll get to you in just a few
Step off the achtung, get back or get stung
Idiotic sense of yourself, are you that dumb?
Entire legion of me, totalitarian
The one and only muthafucka, top of the world man
Cuz I can't stand it, planned it, gonna crash land it
In other words, consider me branded
Another version of me, another version of you
Both barrels - what you gonna do?
All I hear is human noise
You made your own fuckin' choice
I belong to only me
Silence for my revelry
I can over die over time
Filthy hands, stay away from mine
Every reason is a right to hate
Painful clutch - death is fine, gimme mine
Only one of us walks away
Somebody explain this
You don't care cuz you don't exist
What the fuck is this another joke?
Reckoning!
I play doctor for five minutes flat 
Before I cut my heart open...and let the air out 
Three bugs, a pound of dust 
Some wind spilled over me 
In the strangest manner that had 
Broke away my tear spout 
As I lie there 
With my tongue spread wide open 
A black widow had offered me 
A sweatheart tube 
As I injected 
The candid heart that I selected 
She said don't hesitate 
Just do what you have to do! 
It's hard to stay between the lines of skin 
Just cuz I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel 
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway 
Just let the blood run red CUZ I CAN'T FEEL! 
Biding my time until the time is right 
Biding my time until the time is right 
Biding my time until the time is right 
Biding my time... 
It's time 
It is time
Meet the man that made me 
Greet the can that I came from 
Oh the fucking sacred heart of Jesus 
Blew it in the back room 
Feelin' like a real goon 
Slam the fuck aside, man 
I'm on - you're not 
I am the great big mouth 
Good riddance - though I'm sad to say 
I didn't get to kill you 
Rhetoric - Better look both ways 
I gotta get an arm through 
Stain 
What the fuck is up? Get the fuck away 
Run if you want to 
Innocent? You're a guilty conscience 
Laugh last - break through 
Stain 
Prepare you fucker 
I don't give a shit, bitch 
I don't give a fuck, bitch 
I don't understand, bitch 
You don't matter 
I don't give a fuck, man
I don't give a shit, man
I don't really care, man 
I'm the super sized man

...never become Seeds of Death.
With faith you receive deceit
Parts of a fractured whole
Numbers of false equations
That the masses will obey
There is an exit that's kept unknown
For the ones unworthy of the elite
A plan to abandon earth
As we're colonizing another world
World unknown
Beyond this charred place where you were born
As below
So above is the phrase that you seek
Each cell holds a universe within
Fed by a million suns
Expand outwards on repeat
One object holds the key to all
THERE ARE LIMITS TO INFINITY
IN THE RESTRICTED LEMNISCATE
THERE ARE BODIES INFINITE
OUTSIDE THIS EARTHLY DOME
Eradication of the void
We know
Nothing is nothing in this vibrant world
Unveil words of the elite
That seek to gain control
The masters reach ascension
While the slaves must face decay
This is the time when the conquerors of deep space
Reaches out to infinity
And so the unfortunate remain
Feeding upon their own despair
World unknown
Beyond this charred place where you were born
As below
So above is the phrase that you seek
Each cell holds a universe within
Fed by a million suns
Expand outwards on repeat
One object holds the key to all
THERE ARE LIMITS TO INFINITY
IN THE RESTRICTED LEMNISCATE
THERE ARE BODIES INFINITE
OUTSIDE THIS EARTHLY DOME
Soon the day will come
Destruction of the meek
Is imminent
Their programmed fear ensures we will
Be reborn as gods
Culture infected
No venom detected
Agenda erected no charge
Vaccines that promote disease
Tyrants elected
Survivors selected
The dead resurrected to rise
As we merge with the machines
LIMITS TO INFINITY
Fed by a million suns
Expand outwards on repeat
One object holds the key to all
THERE ARE LIMITS TO INFINITY
IN THE RESTRICTED LEMNISCATE
THERE ARE BODIES INFINITE
OUTSIDE THIS EARTHLY DOME

At first denied! 
At first denied and then opposed with Fervor.
Resist subsequently, accepted as being Self-evident. 
No One can avoid A thing whose Time has come.
Emergence of an Idea tear Worldviews apart.
At first we criticize and then we idolize.
Invasive Technology drawn like Moths to Flame.
Behold the Mighty fall down towards Failure and with the End in Sight they discover.
Somewhere along the Road they have lost their Cause, their Souls... their Souls.
Oh, how the Mighty fall down the Spiral.
Caught in Imitation, our Hearts irrational.
Reign above all, then to dissolve...
...in their Downfall others will take their Place.
At first denied! 
At first denied and then opposed with Fervor.
Resist subsequently, accepted as being true in every Sense.

Somewhere along the Road they have lost their Cause, their Souls... their Souls.
Oh, how the Mighty fall down the Spiral.
(Time-shifting Rhyme spirals on and on)
Across this wide Terrain we kill everything, including Ourselves.
(Time-shifting Rhyme spirals on)
Like Moths to the Flame we're drawn, our Wings ablaze in the Midst of our Flight.
Weigh my Heart and see, weight of my Burden.
Humans plagued by programmed Sins through Prayers unanswered.
I will become the Divine.
Embrace Temptation to mutate, recreate my Being. 
My Soul mechanized, ultimate Perfection achieved.
No One can avoid A thing whose Time has come.
Emergence of an Idea tear Worldviews apart.
At first we criticize and then we idolize.
Invasive Technology drawn like Moths to Flame.
Yet all the Mighty fall down towards Failure and with the End in Sight they discover.
Somewhere along the Road they have lost their Cause, their Souls.
Oh, how the Mighty fall down the Spiral.
I choose transformation to mutate, recreate my Being.
Bring modification to erase and replace my Essence now.

The Roman empire has crucified the messiah
The bestial power as sacrificed your Gods
Feared by this power, the cross he'll carry
And visions of destruction, this night you'll see
Crucified, killed, buried
Sacrificed messiah
Kneeled down, blood stained
The cristians, today they still cry
But the bastards adore images
Remembrances from the past, from the crucifixion
Rotting christ, nailed to cross
From the semen of the mankind
We'll spread our seed
And we'll show to the devoted
The truth, painful truth
Cry preachers
Because your Gods has forgotten
The antichrist there is to prove
Death and destruction will still reign
Endless war, endless screams
In the boundaries of Hell we live
Total death, total hate
On the devastated plains we fight
Evil minds, insane minds
Mutilated corpses over the ground
Soldiers of Hell, soldiers of death
Seeking victims to exterminate
Black death, black night
Where the spirits leave their crypts
Torture souls, drifting souls
By the world of hate
Multiradiation, multideath
Destroys and kills
Even in the deep of Hell
Fallen corpse, fallen angel
Total injury is the only rule
MAYHEM
Death slaughter, death rules
Under the sign of fear we live
Bestial lust, bestial rites
Darkness send it's bestial warriors
Shrill crys, tormenting crys
Break the silence of the dark night
Living with hate, living with death
Giving the world total destruction
Blood world, rotting world
Corrosion of insane human mind
Black pest, devastating pest
Under the evoking circle we pray
Baptized skulls, evil skulls
People screaming chained underground
There is no return, there is no escape
In the evil refuge you are slaves
MAYHEM
Total eclipse hides the Earth
The night of doom has come
Antichrist soldiers are proclaimed
To send souls to the Hell
Catastrophe and destruction
Mankind is slaughtered without mercy
Suphul clouds are in the air
Legions winds corrose the universe
The messiahs, redeemers of mankind
Chained in the valley of Hades
Crowds blinded by evil
Only death is real
Total destruction
Walls of churches stained by blood
Altars burning in the flames
The doom cries out for insanity
The nuclear war announces the end of the world
The mankind is buried and forgotten
Prophets forsee the doom
They forsee the triumph of your death
Nuclear warheads fly out for destruction
Insanity and corruption of the Universe
Concentration camps are back again
Third Reich is here between us
Total slaughter is only rule
Kill to live, live to kill
Mass extermination, black death
The corrosion of the world is done
WAR !!!
The radiation corroses our faces
Over mutilated corpses we have to march
Destructed empires, where is God now?
That calls himself the redeemer of the mankind
Infernal visions torment our minds
Pools of blood spreaded through the world
Christians cry in torment
Asking for help to their redeemer
WAR !!!
The black sunset breaks out the silence
The last scream of pain is heard
Death burns it's victims
Sending their souls to Hell
Feel the blade in your sacrifice
Now is the time to abjure Gods
The black war comes with the wind
There is neither Heaven nor Hell, but only war
Massacring the wons
Mutilating the fools
The black death empire
Exterminating without mercy
Waaaaaaarrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!
We deny Gods and his rule
We defy his supreme force
Crucified by the dark power
His death was a glory
Forgotten by our mind forever
He's left the churches to torment us
We'll destroy the high altar
Until we see the ashes of pain
CRUCIFIXION
We'll show to the world our hate
The priests will have their final torment
We'll spit on the churches, we have an ideal
Black tortures you'll feel
The mankind goes to suicide
Thay have faith in Gods as false as their name
Christ, preacher of goodness and beauty
Gods, preachers of lies and destruction
The Gods grave doors
Is below his brains
Rotenness and dirtyness go out
By a simple prayer of mercy
The reason of his death will be your blame
Your master is buried in the abyss
The dead, they already celebrate his arrival
In the altar of fallen Gods, throne of his own existence
Evil warrior
Fight till death
Sons of war
Kill with wrath
Born in a village
He's learn to fight
Grew up with strength
His pleasure is to kill
Sons of evil
He is insane
Maniac butcher
He is feared
He doesn't have religion
Killing is what he wants to false and fools
He there is to torture
Gods of the storm
Infernal death
The blood of victims
Gushes on my hands
Show me the wrath
On the frozen lands
He is born
Living among the barbarian
Violence is his business
He's forget his sword
On the fire of Pandemonium
Blessed by Hell
Feared by christians
His destiny
Is to keep killing
Wild life
Malign creature
The holy temple
He will destroy
He'll dethrone Gods
He'll be emperor of death
The doom is near in this night
Bloody skulls are over the pentagram
Cry for the sabbath bells
Fallen angels scream for mercy
It's a time to bury the priest
On the down of Meggido your grave is dig
The sky turns as black as spell
Haunting my eyes and my mind funeral rites
You are chosen by Hell
Dig your sepulchre
We force you to come in
And we'll bury you alive
Black songs are heard with the funeral
Rotting corpses mutilated over the ground
Graves will violated
And corpses will be stolen
FUNERAL RITES
There is an empire in the boundaries of Hell
Where only the death can reach and only demons reign
Place of lust, blasphemy and eternal darkness
Illusions of the darkness
Power of death
strength of Hell
Empire of the damned
On the black hills of Meggido you'll find
A place so cold as the mist, so dark as the night
Black armies march to the hills
To make power of the reign of darkness crow
The exterminating angels
Here there's to be emperor
To command Nospheratus
Creature of crypts
From the eternal darkness
A blade will shine
Saints and Gods will judged
Killed and buried
One day this empire will be discovered
For the judgement of mankind
Gnash of teeth and endless cries will be heard
The Hell there's to bury, the Heaven there's to dethrone
In the quitness of Heaven
And in the orgy of hades
An empire will raise
Against the churches
And against the priests
It'll be like a concentration camp
A desolate place
Where the sun will be black as the darkness
Decline is the symptom of the failure to evolve forwards
Change was and will be the most permanent element of experience
deny to go on and you will be left back
Going backwards by remaining stagnant
We watch from our abodes
As hawks we cut the electric skies.
With pride
We keep the order, designing fate
We give access to countless futures...
A time of exodus will come.
The time to break out from the womb
And ships will lower down on Taia
On shining arks then we will go
On lands and stars forgotten...
The origin of riddles, what can restore the lunar wings
Is challenge of the underworld
For challenges to come, we will stand against the tide
Under the banner of the brave
Mission AIOEPIA, the future belongs to the brave
Decline is the symptom of the failure to evolve forwards
Change was and will be the most permanent element of experience
We watch from our abodes
As hawks we cut the electric skies.
With pride
We keep the order, designing fate
We give access to countless futures...
The origin of riddles, what can restore
The lunar wings is challenge of the underworld
For challenges to come, we will stand against the tide
Under the banner of the brave
Mission AIOEPIA, the future belongs to the brave
Where the crossroads meet is the axle
Of the grand wheel
The heart that reverberates my beat.
I wear the talisman of Thot,
The sign of our unity
Because it has a part of the universe
A part of me.
And my love is strong because nothing can divide
Me from the object of my ultimate affection.
The ophidian wheel
When the moon steals the crown from its rival
Night enters day. Bring forth the eclipse
The schism that reconstructs my lucid kingdom.
And all my children by their birth right
Wear porudly my crown, my horns of pwer
And those who sense my circle thoughts are all witnesses
Welcome to the joyous carnival of passion
Where the mind surrenders to the animal.
Smell the seductive odor of the naked skin
Bathed in the exotic oils, the potions of desire.
It would be folly to defy the eldest law
For resistance will only supply the fire of lust
With her wooden excuses.
We are here to drink this old wine without remorse
To spill the fluid of Genesis
In abundance because we all know
That as this elixir of life will flow
We will be left exhausted but smiling.
Nails sink into sweaty ground
Marking dionysiac stings
Sparks set from velvet tongues
That bring close soft orange lips
Phallic litanies
Paths lead inside warm nests, that scared shrines of sin
As serpents we crawl beneath
The guises that we all wear.
It would be folly to defy the eldest law
For resistance will only supply the fire of lust
With her wooden excuses.
So it will grow stronger and stronger
Until fatally it will consume the renegades
With the flames of their denied satisfaction
Phallic litanies
Hedonism, power in life without end
Morality and remorse banished
An epitaph of useless beliefs and countless mistakes
Left to the outcasts.
Those who were foudn guilty for self torment
Never admitting so, betrayed by their shiver
While mutilating their happiness
With razor blades of guilt
Their voices rise like an irritating whisper
To the AEONAON fortress
But there is no need for warriors
That can not win their own battles
Razor blades of guilt
No beggars are allowed in, to feast in sympathy
This treasure is kept and shared
With the beloved loyal comrades
Wearing the title of the trinity
Warlord, magician and king
Hands are raised grasping golden cups
In a toast for hedonism.
Power in life without guilt
[Solo: Chris]
A stranger once whispered:
A fallen angel is someone not aware of his authentic identity
Because the fall occured nowhere except on the inner plains
And the broken wing was nothing but the bleeding memory
The creators of the prophecies
Have seen pages yet unturned
From a book that can not be read
Or expressed from mouths of scorn
Observing the divine marriage
Between the solid soil and the ether
Step on the lightnings and ascend
On the topmost step of the earth
Stepping on the belt that surrounds the sphere
Endless are the joys of the infinite quest
For the timeless explorer
And the child that lurks inside
On the topmost step of the earth
Solo: Chris
Stepping on the belt that surrounds the sphere
A billion toys to play, countless more to invent
In the mental playground, around its solid tree
The creators of the prophecies
Have seen pages yet unturned
From a book that can not be read
Or expressed from mouths of scorn
On the topmost step of the earth
On the topmost step of the earth...
Stepping on the belt that surrounds the sphere
Behold that a path is created from these traces of ink,
Letters join numbers
Sounds come forth manifesting the plasticity.
This is the direct outcome of the continuous war
The collision of the worlds of change and stability
One would sense the mind behind them
If only he could withdraw from the relentless alterations of its forms
I have swum against rivers of fallacy
Chaotic symmetry,
And have returned
From the point of weakness
To the root of triumph.
Between the circular entrances of spinning dark suns
I travelled with the company of a triangle
To the dark corners of cosmos
Geometry in static
In frozen wells I left my seal for the future travellers
Sunken trilithons bear my signature
In wombs of yellow on the phosphoric remnants
Of organisims with consciousness long erosed
One would sense the mind behind them
If only he could withdraw from the relentless alterations of its forms
[Solo: Sotiris]
Between the circular entrances of spinning dark suns
I travelled with the company of a triangle to the dark corners of cosmos
Geometry in static
From inside a cloud with the shape of a grey owl
Scanning down the hill of an indian scared site
I can see a figure with hair white like the snow
The polar crystal breath.
Gyrating around the pyre like a planet in orbit
Around the burning mass of a life giving sun
Following the ways of the ageless
Parallel not our paths can cross
In a shower of meteor storm
As you have sung for me
Now I sing for you
As you have welcomed me
Now I welcome you
The shaman
From inside a cloud with the shape of a grey owl
Scanning down the hill of an indian scared site
I can see a figure with hair white like the snow
The polar crystal breath.
As you have sung for me
Now I sing for you
As you have welcomed me
Now I welcome you
The shaman
Let's take our place as stars in the night sky...
A peacock rests alone in the vitreous valley
With an innocent pose like it does not know
On its featheres ventaglia thousands of eyes
Empty since the end of oracles
Clouds create a hollow pillow
For sleepy heads to rest
By denying to submit to the whims
Of their unstable paterns, I glide above them all
Heaven below
Light as a thought, dropping the weight of milleniums
How far can once reach
The answer depends on who this one is
How far can one extend
As far as his limits go...
[Solo: Chris]
Heaven below
A glimpse over this field of sorrow
It's more than meets the eye
But in the eye of the beholder
It's telling secrets and a lie
There is no room for mistakes
Tresspassing to the point of no return
Voices from within
Are my only witnesses to this madness
The truth is hard to see here
As I am twisting your minds
If I fall
I'm taking it with me down
Esoteric remains
All eyes on me
The logic beats the word
Awaiting to see
Endurance beats the restless
I'll never give in
It would mean an impossible ending
The breakdown of me
Must never occur
Must never occur
A vague premonition
That is all there is
Escalating to a nightmare
But here's nothing to see...
A vague premonition
That is all there is
Escalating into a nightmare
But here's still nothing to see
I'm giving you nothing instead of something
Or was there anything I forgot?
Hesitation is never an option
Then in a second it's all over...
The truth is hard to see here
As I am twisting your minds
When I fall
I'm taking it with me down
Esoteric remains
Invested everything in expectations
Gave away it all
Infested is the outcome
But still it's craving for more
Consideration is
What is feeding it
An everlasting
Stream of doubt
Degeneration process
Is commencing
And it is taking its toll
Rise and decay
There is no escape
...
We should pay the price
In times like these
Diminished in a second
The warning came to late
Without reaching it's final destination
...no where
wanting caution for life
like a stab in the back
digging out, everyone cheer
Suppressed, really?
What is there more to see?
Suppressed...
It was just an illusion
glancing with an empty stare
i just cannot believe
focus attention
this is for real, this is now
by now there is no turning back
ones need is the others greed
no one walks away, from this alive
Embrace the darkness
As the night appears
A time I no longer fear
I inhale the cold air and feel how it's soothing my soul one last time
Banned from this world of silence
Now lost to the world below
Don't utter a word
Just go
Go
Nevermore shall we return
Me, myself and I
It's time to let the old world burn
It's time to let go of control
At this point there is nothing holding us back
Listen to the voice within
Close your eyes and let go
Feed the flames and watch them grow
Banned from this world of silence
Now lost to the world within
Don't utter a word
Just go
Go
What is there to mourn?
The effort was a waste
Don't try to comprehend
Answers there are none
Answers there are none
Exemption awaits
As the ending scene is closing in
Go now
And forever be gone
A masterpiece of failure
Your work here is done
Questions remain unanswered
The will to prevail grows stronger
To now know becomes a failure
Proceeding with blindfolded eyes it seems
Impossible to break through
Decisions made to shatter this heaven
Reluctantly it's made so clear
That it's never meant
To come in from another side
To have a lock from another angle
Showing the signs of a great disaster
But who will master
The perception of life...
Reduced the further we go
Witness another fall
Indecision abundant
Darkness descending
A disease neverending
Scars burnt unto our skin
Cover it all within
Facing the facts in denial
Lost to the creation of time
As allegiance is sworn
The inconvenience (upon)
Is taking its toll
Travel through excess
An evocative ride between evident fears
Coming in from another side
Having a lock from another angle
Contemplating the great disaster
That no one will master
The timeline has come to an end
Replace and proceed
Witness another fall
Indecision abundant
Darkness descending
A disease neverending
Scars burnt unto our skin
This is another fall
Indecision abundant
Darkness descending
A disease neverending
Scars are one with our skin
One with our skin
The world moved out of my mind
I made it fiction
When I should have given it time
But still there was no caution
Acting like someone else
Restraining the bitterness
The ironwall won't give in easily
Emptiness, caught while burning
Solitude, live by learning
Bargain for more
With every step further
Withdraw from sanity
And make friend with misery
As the last ditch in this mystery
Realizing the extent
Watching destruction with grief
It will never be the same again
So where is the relief?
Where is the end?
When everything's pushed to the verge
Frequently, impatient
And you are searching for a way out
Transparent, indistinct
Not always so obvious
The true colors are shining through
Deterrent coherence
Shifting to black or white
Inverted inwardly
Reveal the hidden side of you
Like it wasn't enough...
...now burning at both ends
After this you just might be alone
Beware
Prepare
Corroded grounds lying ahead
Erasing is not the cure
The decision is all yours
It's impossible to forget
What has been
Pushed further, down in the gutter
Misery's supremacy
Time has come to choose your side
Restricted, limited
The path is divided here
Engender self defense
Asking for a final solution
Indirect, incorrect
No matter how this turns out
Horrid does disturbance
Either way it's a scar to heal
Didn't know what to expect from the inception
Resurrection
The damnation
Must be broken, must be broken
Curse the inaccuracy
Improvise a way out
To retrospect
You will know if
It was the right
Thing to do then
Deal with the existence
Emptiness, loneliness
You won't just go on after this
Denial, withdrawal
The illusion won't hold much longer
No it wasn't enough...
...burned out
Now you're on your own...
...burned out
Alternate reality
Digging deeper and deeper
Construct emptiness
Out of nothingness
And erase the compassion
Fragments in time
Moments irreplaceable
What's yet to be found
Surrenders to the ignorant
In order to be free
The mind is set to believe
Under a pitch black sky
Where the light is all so absent
With despair in sight
A growing form of indifference
In broad daylight
Zombie-like we walk
Seconds in a decade
Is giving life to the lifeless
It's inside, it fails
The diversion is relocating
And taking a new form
Claiming for even more
Construct emptiness
Out of nothing
And erase the compassion
It's inside, it fails
The diversion is relocating
And taking a new form
Claiming for more...
Even more
The skyline is fading
Surroundings are lost
It is a distorted vision
Addicted to those who proceed
Everything can lose its meaning
Sometimes there is a reason why
Words on the screen...
Those words on the screen
Revealing something and still
Telling nothing
One sentence after another
Searching for you
Something is wrong here, somebody must know
Too torn inside to see it with non judging eyes
Feed us more with these words on the screen
What do we do?
Where do we go?
When answers run out
Left alone
Linger in doubt
Nothing seems to make sense anymore
You disconnect from reality
Searching just to find another way
To explain how and when, where and why
Do you deny?
The words on the screen tell something different
Do you chose to believe?
When answers run out
Left alone
Linger in doubt
Nothing seems to make sense anymore
You disconnect from reality
Silence is broken again
Awakening the monster inside
An indication got hold of you
It was seducing your mind
The first level is now clear
But lies got you nowhere
Left alone
Linger in doubt
Nothing seems to make sense anymore
You disconnect from reality
When answers run out
Left alone
Linger in doubt
Nothing seems to make sense anymore
You disconnect from reality
So much in vain you might think
When it's over everything is lost
Too late to negotiate
Accept or regret it
What once was so cold
Is melting and vanishing
The grand scheme has failed
And the wrath has only begun
Fierce and aggressive
It's piercing through
Who will remember?
The legacy of the defeated
In the long run
It's collecting years in the dust
Overwhelmed by the massive appearance
A breathtaking setback
Over and over
The last scene repeats
Caught barehanded
And disarmed by reality
Emptiness
Silence
What is left
Emptiness
And silence
Is what is left
Images slowly fading
Truth detected
By others neglected
It's like a virus spreading inside
Eating itself out
What's written in blood
Is worth nothing when it's forgotten
Bleed for my pain
Revenge on treacherous snakes
They will pay
Slicing the flesh
Sculptured wounds my catharsis
I will stain
Into the heart
Needle injects gasoline
Convulsions
The one that they betrayed
Has made them this way
Plagued by the bastards
I will kill you
Killed by my rage
Scream at my face
The grisly scars went unavenged
Until now
Deep in the hole
You are not gagged and scream aloud
But unheard
Choke on your vomit
You watch your hands cut off
Then your legs
The one that you betrayed
Will kill you this way
Scarred by the bastards
I will kill you
Killed by my rage
I must kill you
Into the throat
The scalpel slices
Warm blood sprays out
The gushing entices
Pull out your heart
And let you watch
Shove in your mouth
Then stab your crotch
I watch your agony
I am released
From years of pain
Your death averted
My becoming insane
You are dead
I have killed you
[music, lyrics: Webster]
[vocal patterns: Fisher, Webster]
The basement incinerator
Is where they'll put the head
Hose the floor and clean the room
Anywhere they bled
Into boxes go the bags
Fill the space with rocks
In the dark of night
He throws them off the docks
Rotting in the river
Never to be found
Under tons of concrete
Deep beneath the ground
From behind he grabs his mouth
The blade goes to his neck
Bulging veins pumping blood
He struggles to protect
If you don't cut open the stomach
The corpse will rise and float
The victim is discovered dead
Rotting organs bloat
The killer chops the body
With a scalpel and an ax
The parts are then drained
And put into the sacks
Grab the neck, Slit the throat, take the life
Hang the corpse - Prepare to drain the blood
Bone saw, meat cleaver, filleting knife
Carve the corpse - Dissect him in the tub
Smash the teeth, slice off scars, crush the bones
With a crowbar - scrape off all tattoos
If you don't cut open the stomach
The corpse will rise and float
The victim is discovered dead
Rotting organs bloat
The killer chops the body
With a scalpel and an ax
The parts are then drained
And put into the sacks
Chunks of a skull
Sawn in half bones
Body is found
Killer unknown

Follow the one
Evil masked in pride
Charisma to lead
Speeches laced with hate
Leading the dense
The bovine human herd
Inherently stupid
The fools deserve this fate
Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black
Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die
Burning the world
And all of it's life
Throwing all the people
In a pit of fire
Watching the sheep
Gathering to die
Followers in life
Follow to the grave
Follow the one
Evil masked in pride
Charisma to lead
Speeches laced with hate
Leading the dense
The bovine human herd
Inherently stupid
The fools deserve this fate
Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black
Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
Burning flesh
Miasma of their death
Civilisation
It is destroyed
Pits of corpses
Unholy grave of war
Hanging victims
Guilty of free thought
Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black
Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
War of fire shred their souls
Burn in hell doomsday's toll
Failed to see the trap they laid
Demagogues lead them into the flames

Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
Pile the bodies

Blood Drenched Execution
Carnage inspired by hatred and evil
Fatalities the final solution
Feel the fucking pain
I rip your child from your cunt
The fetus is kept alive
To die before caring eyes
Slaves in hell for me
A tortured death will set you free
The executioner
I was meant to be
Born to kill for all eternity
The exsanguination
Savage display of murder and mayhem
Casualities of primal abduction
Red is spraying from
The hole in the baby's head
The slaughter will not subside
This day a family dies
Young blood is so pure
Unborn infant is dead premature
The executioner
Has to mutilate
A fetal pulp is all that remains
Rapid blood loss
Flooding the floor
Gore is unstoppable
Rabid blood lord
Carving the whore
Extremely contemptible
Rancid rancor
Insatiable from my proclivity
Random tirade
Eternal death inevitable
[Solo - O'Brien]
Blood drenched execution

Into the abyss, perpetual and torturous
The gallery of suicide, internal torment
Archaic carcasses, displayed degeneracy
Once within these walls a life of death will be unleashed
Forever dying are the dead, countless bleeding heads
Cadavers splattered red from the self-slicing of necks
Stenching maggot filled bodies, skulls and bones rot away
The slaughtered souls that chose to die, enveloped in death
Darkness is the only light, suicide the way
Hideous forms of human death, mounds of flesh slowly decay
Embrace the horrid nature, carnage on display
Pain never felt
Enslaved inside this massive grave
Life, evil fate
Only slaves to death can survive this place
Die, perdition
Penance in putrid decadence
Dead miscreants
Enter the decrepit necropolis
Lurid interment in the hellish abattoir
Impetuosity and horror, after-life is tortured
Entrails, guts, and blood is this museums decor
Blood, impiety
Chastened are the sanguinary
Purge, radical
They perish, the victims of vagary
Vile tragedy
With great vehemence the hapless died
Kill, suicide
Serrated blades assist in destiny
Death opened the gallery
Sarcophagus
Ecstasy in suffering
Imprecation

Sever the limbs
Decapitate
Yank out the teeth
Then masturbate
Pounding the face
Ejaculate
My darkest needs
I satiate
Bathe in blood
Wallow in bile
Tear out the heart
Victim defiled
Sever the limbs
Decapitate
Yank out the teeth
Then masturbate
Pounding the face
Ejaculate
Entrails slip through my fingers
As I sift through her innards
My body rigid with goose bumps
My erection growing stronger
I put my cock into the carcass
My climax can wait no longer
Expectorate my seed of hate
Onto her mutilated corpse
Sever the limbs
Decapitate
Yank out the teeth
Then masturbate
Pounding the face
Ejaculate
My darkest needs
I satiate
Bathe in blood
Wallow in bile
Tear out the heart
Victim defiled

Her flesh decaying she rises to see
Lecherous ghouls with rotting erections
Her breasts are lactating blood and pus
An orgy of death, cadavers of lust
Gray skinned bodies pulsate as one
Grasping her flesh, erotic undead
Maggots crawl on their rotting cocks
Into her cunt, rigid like rock
Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate
Breeding the damned
Carcasses writhe
Revel in death
Bleeding and sore
Insatiable corpse
Consummate the bonds of death
Beautiful eyes are now vacant pits
Her body contorts, her vagina has fangs
Purtid fluids will mix in her loins
The seed of the undead will grow inside
Hiding from mankind the embryo grows
Nourished by flesh the mother consumes
After the birth the child will grow
Prince of the dead conceived by profanity
Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate
Gifted with speech
The offspring will lead
Establish their reign
Lusting for flesh
But living, not dead
The corpses will rape
Rape!
Lascivious legions of blasphemous ghouls
Kill to create whore of their own
Lust of the dead will multiply
Thousands of corpses beginning to rise
Living again for rape and destruction
Ejaculate bile from their erections
Lascivious legions of blasphemous ghouls
Kill to create whore of their own
[Solo - Owen]
Kingdom of rot the Bastard will rule
Stinking of death, zombies will roam
Through the whore the world was crushed
An orgy of death, cadavers of lust
Licentious masses rejoicing in sin
Larva faced sluts fucking the ghouls
The rancid bodies will copulate
Their barren world they repopulate
Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate

As the blood begins to gush out the side of your neck
I thrust my cold steel into your face, your closer to death
A twelwe inch blade will help decide your ultimate fate
This summons to die has been given to you for accepting my hate
Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived
Vocal cords twitching, esophagus severed, a hemorrhaging brain
Your lacerated jugular vein is spurting away
As mortality fades I am ready to flay your whole body and head
Vigorously carving this fresh human flesh, I am one with the dead
Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived
I'm chewing bloody skin from the cadaver
Consuming lifeless meat, mangled and tattered
Half-eaten corpse lies skinless in the gutter
I am revitalized
Odium, embedded in my skull
To kill and eat your prey a way of nature
The taste of death must consciously be savored
My cannibal existence never dangered
Just look into my eyes
Subjugate, intensity to blame
Gnawing on the head, sliced to fucking shreds
Knife to the gullet results in cessation
[Solo - O'Brien]
Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived

Deathless sin
Led to the place of atonement
Repent through pain
Slicing off proof of guilt
Immortal lust
Blood craving torturers revel
Pain through penance
You will plead for your scourge
Burnt with iron
Retinas scorched
Eyes are blind
Purge the mind
Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life...bleeding
Walls are stained with blood of vice
Learn through scourge
The errors of depravity
Immortal curse
Inquisitors for eternity
Scourging to learn
The stamina of the condemned
Disembowel
Torn apart
Heaving lungs
Severed tongues
Never to speak evil, never again
This is the way it must be
Burnt at the stake or
Stretched on the rack
Burning your soul
Draw out your guilt
Pieces torn off
Pieces that sinned
Tumors that must be destroyed
Chop off a cock or carve out a cunt
Cleansing your soul, bleed to atone
Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life
Bleed on it's infernal walls
Nailed to the prison you made
Scraps of flesh litter the halls
Torture the price has been paid
Disembowel
Torn apart
Never to speak evil, never again
This is the way it must be
Burnt at the stake or
Stretched on the rack
Burning your soul
Draw out your guilt
Pieces torn off
Pieces that sinned
Tumors that must be destroyed
Chop off a cock or carve out a cunt
Cleansing your soul, bleed to atone
Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life
Bleed on it's infernal walls
Nailed to the prison you made
Scraps of flesh litter the halls
Torture the price has been paid

Drawn to an act of complete domination
Violent urges of decapitation
Premeditated murder, invidious
Soon she will be vanquished, insidious
Headless
Headless
Headless
Abscission of her head is what I'm craving
I will become her homicidal savior
Headless
Headless
Headless
Headless
Tainting of the mind, need to obliterate
Inhumanity, desire to decolate
Utmost frustration or totally insane
Either way, in my hands, I will crush her brain
Tainting of the mind, need to obliterate
Inhumanity, desire to decolate
Utmost frustration or totally insane
Either way, in my hands, I will crush her brain
Preparing for medieval demise
A make-shift guillotine out of burcher knives
I'll watch her body quiver from the chaos
Peel off her face and frantically chew her eyes
She finally enters my dwelling of sin
It'll be done in a matter of minutes
As I embrace her for one last single time
In horror I realize, death is mine
I feel the cold blade pierce the back of my neck
The blood spews incessantly, flooding my face
Convulsions and spasms as life fades away
Ironically, I'm the one with no head
Headless
Headless

Die, shattered you'll die
Bones broken in half
Blood flowing freely
Limbs severed in hate
Brains splattered, demise
Skin eaten in wrath
Eyes ripped from your head
Lie shattered, you die
For believing you could be free
Weakness only invigorates me
These broken bones once yours, I hold
Cause of death will never unfold
Torn, mangled, and maimed
Life withers away
In hellish decay
Bones shattered, you die
For not seeing things I see
Your pummeled body strengthens me
These broken bones keep me aware
Of how I lust to shred and tear
Every bone broken is my only goal
Sucking the marrow of your fractured femurs
Every bone broken, your truculent toll
Succumbling to my offensive demeanor
Every bone broken enhances my soul
Your twisted corpse is contorted dead rot
Every bone broken, your life I stole
I'll kill again and I'll never get caught
[Solo - O'Brien]
The snapping and cracking of skeletal remains
The pleasure of devouring decomposed flesh
The feeling of power from crushing your skull
The stench of decay overwhelming my brain
I slaughtered your body and returned it to dirt
Not a trace of proof that you ever existed
Pure satisfaction through what I have accomplished
I'll kill again and I'll never get caught
[music, lyrics: Webster]

Generations
Denying penance
Eternal life reborn
Time and time again
Deny
Salvation
I refuse it
I will not be saved
Return to human form
Murder
Heartless
Bestial
I kill
Without
Pity for victims with untrue gods
My instinct will push beyond
Feelings like guilt, remorse or mercy
My flesh holds a soul of
Generations
Denying virtue
Eternal hate reborn
Time and time again
Defy
Redemption
Spit upon it
My soul they cannot claim
Return to kill again
Butcher
Unclean
Spirit
Searching
Hunting
Another life to maim and kill
A beast with brutal will
Lifetimes spent on a quest for blood
And with my death it does not end
Evil reborn for eternity
Centuries of torment
I will not be saved

When I die
They beg me to repent
I refuse
I return
The past forgotten but evil innate
They have lost
They will not be saved
They will die

Screwdriver repeatedly lands in his face
Gouges and hacks at the man of disgrace
Tearing off muscles from the bones of his chest
Rending his flesh with rage I've been blessed
Chopped off the tongue that told the lies
I spit on him and laugh while he dies
Lying there helpless I throw brick at your head
Starving for violence and now I've been fed
His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
Chopping at his face in hate, I gouge and hack
Crushing the despised
Under my boot I hear your bones crack
So many things that you want to take back
I won't forget and I won't forgive
Not so long as I allow you to live
Chopped off the tongue that told the lies
I spit on him and laugh while he dies
Lying there helpless I throw brick at your head
Starving for violence and now I've been fed
His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
Chopping at his face in hate, I gouge and hack
Crushing the despised
Forces of hate meet
Gather for the siege
Encircling their foe
The raid begins
Their revenge is sought
Through violence, smashing, killing, stabbing, pounding
Iron weapons clash
Evil warriors strike
Hammers cracking skulls
Axes chopping heads
Their revenge is now
Through violence, crushing, maiming, hacking, pounding
Blood soaks the ground
In their own, they will drown
Surrounded by disgust
Pounded into dust
Battle rages on
Bleeding wounded scream
Clubs shatter bones
Swords sever limbs
Their blind rage compells
Their frenzy, bloodlust, madness, burning, hatred
Berzerkers overwhelm
Defenders run in fear
No prisoners today
The end is near
Their blind age endless
No mercy lay waste, wipe out, kill them, kill them
Their struggle to defend
The attack will never end
Surrounded by disgust
Pounded into dust
The captured will be crucified as a warning to the rest
When the killing is completed the city will be burned
Their way of life will be destroyed, no trace of them remains
Annihilate
They lay waste
Eradicate
Victory for their hatred, fury, raging, pounding
[solo-O'Brien]
Blood soaks the ground

I cannot scream, my mouth is wired shut
I cannot see, my eyes are filled with blood
I must die while suffering
Pawn of torturous punishment
Losing all reason to live
Cherishing this painful death
To become part of the
Dead human collection
Dead human collection
I cannot hear with punctured ear drums
I can barely breathe,
My ribs are crushed
I will die while suffering
Maimed, repulsive menagerie
Collection for the insane
Closer to death I become
I want to be one with the dead
Collection of dead humans, dead
I want to be one with the dead
Collection of dead humans, dead
I want to be one of them
Compilation obscene
An assembely for psychotic malefaction
Virulent anarchy
The final member of this vile congreagation
I cannot scream, my mouth is wired rot
I cannot see, my eyes turned into dust
I died into the...
Dead human collection
Dead human
Dead human
Dead human collection

Dormancy
Spirits await rebirth
From their sleep
They will soon awake
Restless dead
Catching the wiff of hate
Blood they anticipate
They will soon drink
Murderers
Subconscious attraction
On their graves
Blood will now spill
Ancient bones
Reform in grounds below
Born, as the blood will flow
Killing is all they know
Blood
They live, they thirst
Blood
Coalesce
Pieces become a whole
For their strength
Blood is absorbed
Rancorous
Aeons of building rage
Death an immortal cage
Now they are freed
Livid beasts
Rising now for revenge
From the past
Hate comes alive
Tenebrous
Restruct evil ones
The demons will come
Cruelity has just begun
Blood
They live, they thirst
Blood, blood
First one that they find
Attack the mortal
Claws tear at his face
Pull the flesh from bone
Decapitate the man
They hold his head aloft
Headless body slumps
The blood is gushing out
Screaming victims fall
Repulsive beasts attack
Gore pours from the torso
Hellish creatures stab
Organs, grisly trophies
Rewards for their rage
Blood drips from their jaws
They disembowel the corpse
Kill with speed
Victims bleed
Wretched souls
Headless on poles
Savage thirst
Vesseles burst
Torn apart
Eat the heart
Vengeance taking form
Endless hatred for the living
Plunderng the world
Paroxysm of the damned
Rapture of their rage
Euphoria from butchery
A dark world will eclipse all life
Barbaric ways forever reign

Fragmentizing, disunite the backbone from the skeleton
Chop the bodies, specialized in customized
Dismemberment
Hatchet wielding, never ending thought of splitered vertebrae
Violent insurgency
Squalid dependancy, ivory interspersion, solace
Riving the arteries, splenetic complacency, somber
Irascible, aggressive ripping head to crotch, life relieving
Propensity, consuming of the spinal cord, dead not living
Animus from perpetual authority, contumacious
Bone displacement surgery
Stagnant, pools of entrails, permeates wretched odors, depraved
Corpses cloven spineless, ultimate pancrea ablate
Violent insurgency, pernicious way of life
Bone displacement surgery, division with an axe

Ecstacy in decy, engrossed in deterioration
Penchant for extreme ordure 
Pervading of vicera
Rejoice in gristly disgust
Exorbiant reality
One thousand years of compiled waste, frenzy in muck intoxicates 
Ecstacy in decay, engrossed in deterioration
Penchant for extreme ordure
Pervading of vicera
Rejoice in gristly disgust
Exuberant castigation
Wading in bile, soaking in guts, ancient inards
Immence oceans of gore, rivers of pus, mountains of bones
Rapture, fester in filth, abnormal wealth immenced in a world of decadence
Mind altered, eternally fetid cadaverous empire
Squelched domain
Swamped ruins, dismal necrotic incarnate metropolis
Lost dwelling

Obfuscated ossuary
One thousand years of compiled waste, frenzy in muck intoxicates

Black forest of evil, a demons possession
A beast in the wild with nocturnal dementia
Unearthly revival of clandestine extinction
Reborn creature, malicious being
Resurgance of a grusome species
With carnal obsession, it lusts copulation
Scent of fresh human blood invades its dominion
Surrounded in darkness, she enters a realm of hell
Infernal quest from a savage of death
Brutal attack, the innocent are unprotected
Hellish fury, deviance provides conception
Vicicious onslaught, its primal lust instinctual
Macabe fuckfest, inside her cunt, the brute's erection
Raped by the beast
Anamialistic, pure hideous appearance
Repulsive re-existence, bearer of morbidity
[Solo - Owen]
Ritual, habitual
Black forest of evil, a demons possession
A beast in the wild with nocturnal dementia
Scent of fresh human blood invades its dominion
Surrounded in darkness, she enters a realm of hell
Raped by the beast

Exhume the rotted casket
Robbing graves
But not for wealth
Cloaked in moldy rags
Hunting dead
Decrepit things from hell
Invade the sacred tombs
Search for food
Embalmed five days before
Ancient body stealers
Raid again
A fresh corpse beyond the door
From the ground they rise
Plundering the grave
When the faithful die
Its them, not God they meet
Consume the rotted body
And unt more
Craving maws ooze blood
Gray skinned coffinfeeders
Seekig carrion
Eat the old ones last
Fiendish ghouls are chewing
Scraps of meat
Found inside the tomb
Roy veiled messengers
From beyond, bring the parish doom
From the ground they rise
Plundering the grave
When the faithful die
Its them, not God they meet
Unholy creatures swarming the coffin
Fighting for mouthfuls of flesh
Invading the tombs of the recently buried, to feast
Starvation of aeons sated tonight
Foraging ghouls consume
Ancient hunger awakened again
[Solo - Owen]
Strengthened by blood the undead attack
Septic beats from the grave
If living approach they are devoured too
Fragments of corpses nourish the pack
Fresh entrails they crave
The coffin is torn open, the zombies start to consume
From the ground they rise
Plundering the grave
When the faithful die
Its them, not God they meet
[Music - P. O'Brien, Lyrics - P. Mazurkiewicz]
Memory of the insane
Of killing in so man ways, homicidal
Seeking redemption through rage
With hacksaws I decapitated them all
Blood covers the groud, my feet are saturated
Rotting flesh scattered around, I feel no remorse
I don't remember my name
Or when blood of the dead flowed so relentlessly
Extracting the brains from the skulls
My anger evolves with the more heads I deform
Sawing the neck I am engulfed in fantasy
Chew the esophagus, cannibal delicacy
Utterly execerbated, forver deleterious
Slicing through skin, sundered larynx, veins spraying blood
Tattered windpipe, facial carvings, another head to abhore 
Beheading sustains my desire
Enhancing my primitive mind
Annihilation without repreving
[Solo - O'Brien]
Memory of the insane
Of killing in so man ways, homicidal
Seeking redemption through rage
With hacksaws I decapitated them at will
Predacious, violent killing spree
Abolished, putrescent cadavers
Butchered in excrement, sordid obscurity
Feverish hunger to inhale the stench of their death
[Music - A. Webster, Lyrics - P. Mazurkiewicz]
Scourged through searing
Incandescence
Melt together
Fire torture brings me intense pain
Pre-destined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold as one as my blood is boiling
Blowtorch slaughter
Bodily capitiluation
Blowtorch slaughter
Blowtorch slaughter
Merciless disintegration
Pre-destined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold as one as my blood is boiling
Conflagration through my veins
Desensitized, charring skin, burnt within,
branded soul, torrid cruelity
Dwidle away, glowing heat to mutilate
Head set ablaze, consumed in flames
I burn to the ground
Blowtorch slaughter
[Solo - Owen, O'Brien]
Pre-destined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold as one as my blood is boiling
Blowtorch slaughter
Merciless disintegration
Fire torture takes me to my end
[Music and Lyrics by A. Webster]
Change has begun
After the shape
Freakish events
Led to this change
Convert the man
From the norm
Alteration
Surreal figure
Misshapen thoughts
Sickening metamorphosis
Twisting flesh
Ghastly face
Pain distress
Mind displace
Twisted flesh transforming appearnce of the
Ghastly face of the one that it chose
Pain distress of contortions and straining
Mind displaced as the spirit arose
Hideous one
Adapting fast
New skin grows out
Old skin peels off
Extra limbs sprout
Mutilation
Alteration
Surreal figure
Misshapen thoughts
Sickening metamorphosis
Shifting bones
Gnarled limbs
Gruesome change
Features grim
Shifting bonestrans forming the framework and the
Gnarled limbs are beginning to grow
Gruesome change to repellent appearance
Features grim in compelete overthrow
Tentacles extending from the face
Eyes are growing on his hands and back
Spikes and fangs cover his body
Skeleton re-shapes, bons pop and crack
[Solo - O'Brien]
A Monstrous thing he has become
Murderous compulsions flood his mind
Reconstruction reaches completion
He's no longer part of mankind
Altration
Surreal figure
Misshapen thoughts
Sickening metamorphosis
Twisting flesh
Ghastly face
Pain distress
Mind displace
Twisted flesh transforming appearance of the
Ghastly face of the one that it chose
Pain distress of contortions and straining
Mind displaced as the spirit arose
[Music and Lyrics by A. Webster]
Butchering the helpless
Was his way of life
Uncontrolled rage
Internal strife
The pain he dealt out was never repaid
Retribution was sought by the ones he had slain
Infernal phantasm
Condemned to agony
No escape after death
Condemned to agony
Heads of his victims
Have returned to haunt
Dripping with blood
Rotted and gaunt
The pain is reflected to him after death
With the victis of his knife, he is now beset
Reliving every crime
Condemned to agony
No escape from their hate
Condemned to agony, agony
He thought he got away
His crimes unpunished he took them to the grave
Their tortured souls are waiting
Now they make him pay
Exact their revenge using methods that he used
To make him understand them
To chop him up
Is their revenge
With no remorse
They slash him, disfigure
Undying hate
His torment endless
He's torn apart and they cut the pieces smaller
The knife he used to maim
Is turned against him and now they will do the same
Dissect the man of evil
His fingers are cut off
And forced into his mouth so that he cannot scream
And in pain they revel
[Solo - Owen]
To chop him up
Is their revenge
With no remorse
They slash him, disfigure
Abomination
Their creation
The man who killed them is now scattered
In the abyss
[Solo - O'Brien]
Infernal phantasm
Condemned to agony
No escape after death
Condemned to agony
[Solo - O'Brien]
Buried waist deep gagged and bound
Piles of heads lie on the ground
Executioners start to assemble
Condemed man shakes with fear
Doom now becoming clear
The faces of the heads he resembles
Severed
Head
Stoning
His family's head strike him
The most recent victims
Without mercy savage killers throw
His wife's head breaks his jaw
Bruised flesh becoming raw
From many wounds blood begins to flow
When the victim dies
They chop off his head
Severed head stoning
Bady beaten, in a daze
Eye pops out, fluids spray
Pulsing veins cause the wounds to gush
The end is near the bloody stumps
Mangeld face a mass of lumps
What was now a man reduced to mush
Mashed into a pulp
Dozens of bones break
[Solo - Jack Owen]
Severed head stoning
Horrific perception that enters the brain
An abnormal psyche insanitys brain
Cemented beyond immeasurable doubt
Psychotic or not they need a way out
Of their obscured minds
If they want to be set free
Lunatics of wrath
Horrid killing viciously
Like incisions
With conviction
Various deaths
Identical
In hell they will find
It is where they need to be
Murder redefined
Butcherd meticulously
Killed the same way
On the same day
Various deaths
Identical
Psychotic precision, Psychotic precision, Psychotic precision
Psychotic precision
Psychotic precision, Psychotic precision, Psychotic precision
Psychotic precision
[Solo Jack Owen]
Aware not of tge cruel visions each had
To slaughter alike they must truely be mad
Rewarded with blood on their ignorant hands
These psychos precisely slew many men
With their obscure minds
Feeling that they were set free
Murder redefined
Butcherd meticulously
Like incisions
With conviction
Various deaths
Identical
Killed the same way
On the same day
Abysmal deaths
Imperceptible
Torn from your body, removed while you scream
Dissect to collet my blade now reams
Pieces of flesh lie by the side
Worn on my body or put on display
You mark your skin it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died
Decency defied
Crudely I cut away
All are my prey
Tell me how it feels when your flesh is peeled
You are vain with your art
I desire it torn appart
With my insane hunting the removal of flesh now starts
You mark your skin, it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died
Decency defied
To you a design
Now a trophy made mine
To you a design
Now a trophy made mine
I seek to find
To satisfy my fucked mind
I seek to find
To satisfy my fucked mind
[Solo Jack Owen]
Ignoring your cries
Exposing your insides
Violence defined
Torn from your body, removed while you scream
Dissect to collect, my blade now reams
Pieces of flesh lie side by side
Worn on my body or put on display
You mark your skin, it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died
Decency defied
Intestines exposed
By violent thrusts
The innards removes
Dissecting the guts
To rip through the skin
Tissue and muscle
Cartilage shreading
Draining blood vessels
Frenzied hacking
Morals lacking
Eviscerate
Life is gone before my eyes
Flesh matters the most
When splattered around
Its never morose
Absurdly profouned
Fresh insides come out
Excitedly done
My purpose in life
To kill just for fun
Frenzied hacking
Morals lacking
Eviscerate
Life is gone before my eyes
Frantic disembowelment
Deprived of vital content
Organ loss without consent
Spastic slicing an event
Sharpend steel my covenant
Frantic disembowelment
Mutilating miscreant
Sickening accomplishment
Spreading gore is ime worth spent
Perpetuate this mad intent
Eternally malevolent
Frantic disembowelment
Kidneys exposed
The pancreas flew
Stomach deleted
The spleen I did chew
The carving is over
You lost and I won
Fulfilling my dream
I killed you for fun
Frenzied hacking
Morals lacking
Eviscerate
Life is gone before my eyes
Frantic disembowelment
Concieved through rape
Procreate
A vicious brood
Ravaging intercourse
Penetrate with force
Forsaken, nude
Spawn of the wretched, born of the rape
Dawn of the murdering beasts of hate
Spawn of the wretched cunt defiled
Pawn of the darkness, blasphemous child
The wretched spawn, inheretly vile
Inherited traits
Reprobate
From birth an urge
No chance to change
Born deranged
Violence will emerge
Spawn of the wretched, born of the rape
Dawn of the murdering beasts of hate
Spawn of the wretched cunt defiled
Pawn of the darkness, blasphemous child
The wretched spawn, inheretly vile
Spawn of the wretched, bred from the damned
Gone are the instincts normal for man
Spawn of the wanton loins of the cruel
Spanwed by brute force used as a tool
The wretched spawn, violence will rule
Heredity dictates brutality
Groomed to carry the legacy
Genres of the butchers, a killing breed
Revel in making the helpless breed
Scion of the murders
A bloodline so profance
Born insane
Predestined to annihilate
Throught sinister eugenics
Sworn to kill, they will
It was made to kill
[Solo Jack Owen]
Massacre the innocents
A slaughter without meaning
Bleed, screaming
Only one remains untouched
Her fate is violation
Vile
Impregnation
Staking out the residence
Of the chosen target
Entering the empty home
Lace the food with poision
The hapless victim never had a chance
Precise contamination killed him fast
Shocking news traveld fast
But I have traveled faster
The only clue thats left behind
Poision in the cadaver
Cyanide assassin is my trade
Exacuting methods are my quarry's bane
Toxic killing tactics stop your breath
Precision dosage leaves the victim dead
Cyanide assassin
Life, my task to end
Death, I dont regret
Analyze the next assignment
Select the proper tools
Gas will be the most effective
That is what I'll use
Release the vapors in the victims room
Sleeping chambers fast become a tomb
Calculated venting should work fast
Enclosed space filled with poision gas
Cyanide assassin
Life, it should end fast
Death, he now should pass
Gasping, he fights for air
Face, fixed with dispair
But the end does not seem close
Misjudged the lethal dose
I must return, my works not done
He's still alive, but to weak to run
[Solo Jack Owen]
A sloppy job must be finished
Can't leave him in a coma
With my mask I wont smell
The almonnd like aroma
With syringe in hand I walk into his room
He's struggling with the damage from the fumes
I plunge the needle deep into his vein
Completion of the murder ends his pain
Cyanide assassin
Eyes tied tight forever
Mouth wired shut forever
Body parts dissever. You will see no more
Never....
Lowerd into the ground
You will never hear another sound
In your coffin you are bound. Underground
Forever
To the earth you're now enslaved, to the creatures long depraved
Flesh has now turned to grey, as the larve gnaw away
As you rott in your smallish tomb, insects care not how you met your doom
In your casket eternally lie. Many were pleased to see you die
Fester
In the
Crypt where
You lie
Victims
Pass by
They watched
You die
Flesh melts off your frame. Infamous was your name
Years passed since you moved on
Nothing left buy carrion
Festering in the crypt
As I walk behind her, her scent trails to me
What is it that draws me neared, what could it be?
Once I was normal among the sheep
Now I'm immortal, in the night I creep
She will pay, with the only life that she now knows
Captured by the gender she loathes
Now she is tied, terrified, set aside
As I prepare she stares as I tear at the garment she hides behind
Her young flesh is so devine
One final deed, she will plead, I proceed
Satisfying my urge, I will scourge, as I surge through her hallowed feminine domain
From her young body. I can't abstain
Lifeless she now lies, now untied I defile
Carefully scoring her skin I begin from within
Removing her organs inspected
Still nothing detected
[Solo Jack Owen]
One way to achieve
The info that I need
Continuing to cleave
[Solo Jack Owen]
Gradually consumed
She was foredoomed
Body one big wound
Now I am through as I chew on the few pieces that remain
Of the brain, nothing gained, I continue my
Searching in the night for the one who fulfils my plight
Nothing left to mutilate
Nothing left to mutilate
[Solo Jack Owen]
Smash his scrotum sac
Allered ferociously
Survived this attack
Sterile now left to bleed
Emptied in the croth
Gonads reduced to pulp
Hateful remedy
Void of sexuality
Sledgehammer destroys
Groin tattered and maimed
Emasculate
Crushing the testicles fast
Gebillitate
Cutting off the penis last
Macerate
Deforming
Enervate
Caponized
Detatched genitals
Mangled between the thighs
Gelded painfully
Transformed before his eyes
Blood spews everywhere
Deprived of virtility
Sledgehammer destroys
Groin tattered and maimed
Inactive
She crushed the testicles fast
Disintegrate
She cut off the penis fast
She cut off the penis last
Inactivate
She crushed the testicles fast
Disintegrate
She cut off the penis last
Macerate
Deforming
Enervate
Caponized
[Solo Pat O'Brien]
Blunt force castration
Giving life is done
Blunt for castration
Desexualized
Blunt force castration
[Solo Jack Owen]
Macerate
Deforming
Enervate
Caponized
Smash his scrotum sac
Altered ferociously
Survived this attack
Sterile now left to bleed
Hatefull remedy
Void of sexuality
Sledgehammer destroys
Castrated with blunt force
Climbing the mounds to escape from death
Ten thousand left to rot
In this gorge
Bodies lie
Putrety
I wont die
Suffocating stench of corpse's warfts
Up from the bits of deaths
Fumes disgorge
Rancid heap
Walls steep
Vapors creep
Underneath
Putrid tide
Rotted body
Land
Slide
Genocide
Mountains of dead mark the place where they died, they died
Transfixed with horror as the corpses fall
Flesh sloughs off as I try to grasp
Start to slip
Suffocate
Corpses weight
Steals my fate
Underneath
Putrid one
Rotted body
Land
Slide
Genocide
Anguish eternally fixed in their eyes
Rotted body
Landslide
Avalance of cadavers down the mountainside
Slide
Genocide
Mountains of the dead mark the place where they died
They died
Bodies of the dead
Smother me with rot
Remains are crushing me
Decomposing mound
This is where I die
Nameless dead my witness
Slide
Genocide
Anguish eternally fixed in their eyes
Rotted body
Landslide
Avalanche of cadavers down the mountainside
The outlander walked into town, coverd in gore
He knew he could not wait much longer, he needed more
Death
Pain
Terror
Blood...
On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains weill allways show for all time
Wasting no time he began defiling whores
He would be the last man they felt, a carnivore
Tear
Rape
Ravage
Maim
On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one knows
Their bloodstains will always show for all time
Firing, loaded rifle, never ending killing spree
Slashing with machette, body parts are the debris
There is no escape, he holds your fate as the death rate climbs to the fullest extent
One more town, slowly going down
This is the comming of endless torment
[Solo Jack Owen]
Unburied victims lie, blood soaking into the sand
Remains of the slain, a dead body wasteland
There is no escape, he holds your fate as the death rate climbs to the fullest extent
One man left, sherif bereft, faces the stranger with intent
[Solo Pat O'Brien]
On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains will always sho for all...
Time
Expired
Big iron
Both die
On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains will always sho for all...
Slain
Twisting limbs untill they break
Contortions wrenching pain
Joints are hyperextended
Opposite
Fibrous tendons snap
Bent
Backwards and broken
Hateful physical control
Opposite ways
Elbows bend and pop
Fingers cracking
Connective tissue torn
Unrelenting warping strain
Knees are shattered
Sinew ripped from bone
Ankles give way
Back is arching
Spinal pressure builds
Total collapse
Predacious entanglement, form is distorted
Grotesque rearrangement, body contorted
Splintering bones causing internal bleeding
Abundance of injuries, pain is exceeding
Every joint in the body is turned the wrong way
A debt to the nemesis forcibly paid
Arching the back
Vertebrae crack
Fracture the spine
Can't realign
[Solo Jack Owen]
Torque on the neck
Structure is wrecked
Amorphous blob
An end to macabre
A torturous lesson in physical terms
The only way some people learn
Stretching the body in every direction
Forcing the joints unnatural flexion
[Solo Pat O'Brien]
Twisting limbs until they break
Contortions wrenching pain
Bent
Bent
Bent
Backwards and broken
Violence is legitimate is causes such as this
Cruel retribution is fitting
Vengeance will be dealt out with ruthless iron fist
Worthless filth recieve no mercy
They deserve to die
They deserve to die
Plans have been completed and the time is drawing near
Punishment will be relentless
They deserve to die
They deserve to die
Vacuous faces hammered into mash
Beaten senseless, sense they never had
Merciless smashing shatters teeth and bone
Ignorance earned every crushing blow
Killing has just started and my lust for blood will grow
Justice will be found in murder
Stupid as they are they didn't know the seeds they'd sown
Grew into my savage hatred
They deserve to die
They deserve to die
Skull is fractured by the pounding
Eyes dislodging from their sockets
Brains spill out, the skull is split through
Mind vacent, now cranium too
Guilty thoughs will not infect me
Soulless scum recieve no pitty
Deceptive tounges hewn by my blade
Forked like a snake now on the ground they lay
They had no conscience so there is no loss
For my redemption there must be a cost
[Solo Pat O'Brien]
They deserve to die
They deserve to die
DIE!!!!
[Solo Jack Owen]
Climbing
Heights unimagined unattained
To drop bodies from the sky
Falling
Alive in mid air moving fast
Heads exploding on the ground
Throwing
Corrupted souls in front of trains
Just to watch the bodies fly
Grinning
At the site of shredded innards
Brains exploded all around.
High velocity impact spatter.
Slamming
You into walls excessive speed
Creates catastrophic sounds
Scraping
Fresh blood and guts from off the pavement
Before stench of death sets in
Piercing
Between the eyes and unexpected
Liquid red spraying behind
Killing
Impact spatter brutal force
Something I will always need.
High velocity impact spatter.
A necro potion is made
From the remains of the dead
[lead - O´Brien]
Daily ritual intake
Drinking remains of the dead.
[lead - O´Brien]
Death after life after death
Only obtained in one way.
High velocity impact spatter
A sharpened sense of supreme evil
Triggered in the mind
A gruesome transformation of the body
And the soul
A dreaded life of worthlessness
Now has a new meaning
Wreak havoc like a vile wretch
Possessed until the end
Anger
Released
Torture
Returning
Sadistic embodiment
Sadistic embodiment
Spreading the corruption
Flowing is destruction
To obliterate all that is good this world
A sharpened knife to butcher people
Sitting in the hand
For gruesome transformations of
The body and the soul
Their dreaded lives of worthlessness
Will have a new meaning
Wreak havoc on a vile wretch
Dissected until dead
Anger
Released
Torture
Returning
Sadistic embodiment
Sadistic embodiment
Spreading the corruption
Flowing is destruction
To obliterate all that is good in this world
You were in the way
The mutilation leads to death
Existence now irrelevant
Never will be in the way again
The mutilation leads to death
Existence now irrelevant
Never will be in the way again
[Solo: O'Brien]
Vicious
Anger
Released
Torture
Returning
Sadistic embodiment
Sadistic embodiment
Viral contagion unleashed upon the earth
Billions of infected dead soon rise
Stalking the living to feast upon the flesh
Its fight or flee to survive
Living out the days and nights in absolute fear
Never knowing when and where the
threat of the undead draws near
Thoughts of those left behind
Are slowly tormenting your mind
Killing is essential to survive
The world you once knew forever changed
Scavenging just to stay alive
Time to release your inner rage
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack all their heads off
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack their fucking heads off
If you want to live you have to kill or become
There's no other way you have to kill or become
If you want to live you have to kill or become
There's no other way you have to kill or become
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack all their heads off
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack their fucking heads off

Fire up the chainsaw
Hack all their heads off
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack their fucking heads off
Trapped beneath rotting remains
A slow decay of life takes its form
Withered death and bone emerge
From cemeteries of the earth
Replacing all that is known from this world
Towering structures take shape
As more cities are laid to waste
Survivors of this morbid fate
The reborn meek not live not dead
Are left to start a new
Misshapen and half mutated
Not a zombie not a human
Evil creatures grew
Not one thing left alive but them
The strongest will begin to reign
A new society takes place
Where the way of the cannibal
Rules in this skeletal domain
A kingdom of the damned
Carnal war consuming them by
Eating flesh for nourishment
Solution for a short-term survival
Slaughtered are the weakest first
Feeding those with evil thirst
As blood of the dead saturates the ground
Again the end has begun
Another kingdom will be damned
Survivors of this morbid fate
The reborn meek not live not dead
Are left to start a new
Misshapen and half mutated
Not a zombie not a human
Evil creatures grew
Not one thing left alive but them
The strongest will begin to reign

The strongest will begin to reign
A new society takes place
Where the way of the cannibal
Rules in this skeletal domain
No hesitation as the bloodshed begins
Frenzied violence, raging death
Devastation as the killers
Savagely murder all in sight
Mutilators swarming hacking off limbs
Falling bodies, severed heads
Pure destruction by the mob
Butchering all that they can see
Honing their insanity
Headlong into carnage without fear
Ruthless human weapons with no conscience, unaware
Rampaging killers slash with furious hate
Bones are breaking, blood is spilled
Mutilation feeds their hunger
Brutally killing satisfied
Relentless slaughter innards hang from their blades
Disembowelment, of their prey
In the bloodbath all their vile
Dreams will come to pass
Weaponized psychopathy
Headlong into carnage seeking blood
Seething minds distorted by the violence and pain
Driven by adrenaline
Headlong into carnage they attack
Merciless and brutal take the head off of your neck
Sweat flies while throats are cut
Tendons snapping, sinew tearing
Blood pours from gaping wounds
Sadistic chaos, grips you
Bones crack from heavy blows
Fractured cheekbones, shattered skull
Bludgeoning without remorse
Eyes bulge and spurt out blood
[Solo: O'Brien, Barrett, O'Brien, Barrett]
Extensive killing many thousands have died
Bodies rotting, stench of death
Desolation as the killers
Scavenge the corpses of the slain
Insane desire, killing cannot end
Psychotic evil, mania
Stimulation by the blood
Searching for people they can kill
Weaponized psychopathy
Headlong into carnage seeking blood
Seething minds distorted by the violence and pain
Driven by adrenaline
Headlong into carnage they attack
Merciless and brutal take the head off of your neck
Coercion and threats
Made their demands
Held the past over my head
One mistake has made me their tool
Blackmailing a means to the end, I'm forced into the pact
Murderer
Is this what I am?
Homicide
How can I stop this?
Not a violent man but now I'm forced to kill
Seems to be no other way
Trapped by an accident, tragic and fatal
The crime was unintentional, but this I cannot prove
Murderer
Is there no way out?
Suicide
Is that the answer?
Desperation
Deal has been made
No turning back
I'm bound to kill by the murderer's pact
Steel myself for the task at hand
Preparing the tools that I need
Sharpen the blades, make the kill quick
Extortion drove me to the deed, I take from it no joy
Murderer
Now I will do this
Homicide
I have made my choice
Sins of the past
Haunt me today
Should have confessed
Motive concealed
Undetected
Hunting him down
His life will end
I'm bound to kill by the murderer's pact
Thrust of the blade repulses
Commit the heinous crime
Stabbing him repeatedly
Gouge his neck, slash his face
See his look of terror
He knows his time has come
Cannot show him mercy
Make him die, finish it
[Solo: O'Brien]
Blood on the knife
His body slumps
Corpse left to rot
The deed is done
But in my mind
There is no peace
Two dark secrets
That I must keep
I'm bound to kill by the murderer's pact
Stand before the corpse
Of the man I killed
His mother is behind me
Puts her hand on my shoulder
Torment deep inside
To be unleashed on those inside
Starting with this bitch
I grab her arm and smash
Her body on her lifeless son
A day of mourning fuels annihilation
I will kill them all by funeral cremation
Relatives must die
Of the man I killed
One by one destroyed
Nothing left when it is over
Torment deep inside
To be unleashed on those inside
Ending with his kids
Blood is flowing from their bodies
Out of misery
Out of their misery
In with my cruelty
Erase the present
To forget the past
Chaotic fury
Was driven by fear
Fear so intense
My whole family was slaughtered by me
[Solo: O'Brien]

Murderous ways
Proclivity for violence
No remorse or shame
Murder, a fascination
Dispatching those who trust
My compulsion
Fleeting fulfillment
No joy will ever last
The soulless walk among you
Concealed by deceit
Smiling when I face you
Slashing when you turn
This vector of cruelty
Denied me a soul
Genetic mutation
Driving me
Your pleas cannot move me
No mercy to give
I seek domination
A master of pain
This vector of cruelty
Emotionless, cold
No human connection
Weakening
Cold-blooded and willful
I slaughtered them all
They thought I'd protect them
But I made them die
Legacy, abnormality
The ladder twists, and the rungs are broken
Impregnate, and the vector spreads
Momentum shifts, and I start controlling
Parasite, of morality
Malevolent, eyes are empty
Merciless, I cannot care

Cold-blooded and willful
I slaughtered them all

But I made them die
Stalking his prey
He prepares for the ambush
I hear his steps
But without trepidation
Hyper aware
I will strike back
When he brandished the blade
Gave his intentions away
Back to the wall, I have no choice
It's time to fight or die
I will respond with overwhelming force
A switch turns on and I must survive
Fearless resolve
As I spring into action
Quickly disarm
And remove his advantage
Only one thing on my mind
Stop his attack
Now he's on the defense
Momentum is shifting my way
A savage brawl, I hear his voice
Pure terror in his cries
Break his balance, slam him to the ground
Following through to stay alive
Landing multiple blows
The blood is starting to spray
Will not stop till I am sure
The threat has been put down
Raining down with forearm thrusts
Torrents of blood flow from his eyes
Bloodstained cement
No weakness to exploit
His ambush failed
Hammer fists break facial bones
Knuckles bleed from shards of teeth
Smash his skull onto the pavement
Make the bastard pay
Don't stop until it cracks
And spills out his brain
Bloodstained cement
[Solo: O'Brien]
When he chose me as prey
A fatal mistake was made
Consequences of his choice
Led to his bloody end
Warning potential assailants
Target you choose could be your death
Such a grisly display
The ultimate price has been paid
Standing breathless I see him
Dead in a pool of blood
Never again will he terrorize
Executed by his final mark
Die every day
Dying for years now
Kill every day
Killing for years
Revive every day
Reviving for years now
Kill every day
You have died and

Revive every day
Reviving for years now

You have died and

While you see the dark
I see the light
A light so dark controlling me
Altering who I'm supposed to be
Die every day

Always the same
Killed every day
Dying for years
Revived you for years
Kill you for years

A light so dark controlling me
Altering who I'm supposed to be
A light so dark controlling me
Altering who I'm supposed to be
Putrid mess lays in the woods
Removed of organs and meat
Hollowed out except for maggots
That dwell
Deep inside the skulls
Of victims that they cleaned
How did this horror unfold
No trace of evidence was left behind
At this scene of gore
Will the truth ever be told
Only time will tell
Will there be more to find
Some more hollowed bodies
Will there be more to find some more hollowed bodies
With their untold stories
Cadavers rot
Cadavers rot hollowed
In a line
Why did this horror unfold
Will the truth ever be told
Only if I tell
Will there be more to find
Some more hollowed bodies
Will there be more to find some more hollowed bodies
With their untold stories
Cadavers rot
Cadavers rot hollowed
Bodies were found
Hollowed bodies
Bodies were found
Hollowed bodies

Merciless suicide realm
Treacherous antichrist haze
Sacrifice your life to me
The monarch of inhuman seeds
Send your corpse away
Rid you all of pride
Fucking time to die
Torture you even when dead
Bury the way of the lamb
Cover your body with chains
Mourning throughout the land
Send your corpse away
Rid you all of pride
Fucking time to die
And the scars I will see
Like the face of the moon
Cast no blessings at me
Necro as fuck!
And the scars you shall see
Like the face of the moon
Cast no blessings at me
Necro as fuck!
White burning sands
Pale yearning hands
Fainting hollow eyes
Necro-world will fucking rise
Come on!
White burning sands
Pale yearning hands
Dying Jesus son
Atrocities have not yet begun
Send your corpse away
Rid you all of pride
Fucking time to die
[Music: Anders Odden / Lasse Johansen, Lyrics: Anders Odden / Ole J�rgen Moe]
DDecomposed metal skin
Decomposed metal skin
Do you know that you are dead?
Scream you fuck
Who is now your king?
Do you know where you belong?
Septic fumes of putrefaction
Massacre
Unholy war
Horded of flesh are to be wasted
Bloodstained sand
Death and gore
Raining flames are falling down
Lightning strikes
Paranoid
Hide behind the metal shields
Live to die for the humanoids
You are dead
Decomposed metal skin
Do you know that you are dead?
Scream you fuck
Who is now your king?
Do you know where you belong?
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Fists in the air!
I did slay the beast
The martyr is dead
Ea

Help carry him now to his maker
God � the enslaver of the frightened and weak

Jesus is dead!

Live to die for the humanoids
You are dead

Live to die by the evil oath
Scapegoats of the blind and weak
Recreate
Reform our way of life
Dominate
Our way of death
Signs are written in digital sand
The storm is still just a swift breeze
The unforeseen is yet to be revealed
To be revealed
Omen one � is still to come
Omen two � is still due
Omen three � will let them free
Omen four � you fucking whore
Omen five � are you still alive?
Live to die by the evil oath
Scapegoats of the blind and weak
Recreate
Reform our way of life
Dominate
Our way of death
Signs are written in digital sand
The storm is still just a swift breeze
The unforeseen is yet to be revealed
Omen six � fire on the Styx
Omen seven � there is no heaven
Omen eight � will choose your faith
Omen nine � will hit you blind
Omen ten � you are one of them
Evildoers � evil is done
Evildoers � all earth-life is gone
Evildoers � will hit you blind
Evildoers � enter the gates
Omen six � fire on the Styx
Omen seven � there is no heaven
Omen eight � will choose your faith
Omen nine � will hit you blind
Omen ten � you are one of them
You are one of them
You are one of them
You are one of them
You are one of them
You are one of them!

Their souls omit from their necks
Hung up our blade carves new beliefs
We ridicule your ancestry
And thoughts of holy union
We condemn and clave
The earth trembles
As our machinery slithers forth
It slithers forth
Pass your religions
Pass your lies
Minerval worshipper of he who dies
Pass your religions
Pass your lies
Eater of all
Bringer of hate
Bringer of hate
Ritual extinguisher
Emperor of deceit (Fuck your god)
In possession
Darkness before light
Jehovah, come to realize Satan is might!
Satan is might
Might!
Submit to the void
Fuck your god
Submit to the void
Carcass anima mundi lover
Posing in rotting flesh
All the human you can be
You can be!
The souls omit from their necks
Hung up our blade carves new beliefs
We ridicule your ancestry
And thoughts of holy union
[Music: Anders Odden / Carl-Michael Eide, Lyrics: Anders Odden]
Dig your way to misery
Spark eternal hatred
Burn all bridges
Set it free
Your time here has been altered
Awakening
Free your mind
Insanity made you blind
Awakening
Free your soul
Let your cold winds unfold
See the storm on the horizon
One man against it all
Without fear
Mind control
You are ready for your quest
Awakening
Free your mind
Insanity made you blind
Awakening
Free your soul
Let your cold winds unfold
Bloodline from the Stone Age
Primitive and old
Eyes like reptiles let you see
Brain mass blurs the imagery
I cannot hide from life or death
I want to be alone
My eyes can�t see what you can see
I see no flesh or bones
Dig your way to misery
Spark eternal hatred
Burn all bridges
Set it free
Your time here has been altered
Goatfather�s son
Sacred holy words of loyalty claiming your salvation
When the timing of the rulers of your life is depending that their words
Are truly reviling you from pain you feel when you wait to die...
Your pain
Blinded you sacrifice your mind for their beheading
Of all you are when time is running out
A soldier nothing but a piece in the puzzle
Lead by those you should not have trusted with your life
With violence our life is measured up against the idea of pride
You forget your quest for the new ideas to fill your daily needs
No one lives for anything but earthly matters
No protection is given you if you don�t become a slave...
In time
[Music: Anders Odden / Lasse Johansen, Lyrics: Anders Odden]
Gaze into my dying eyes
The light is killing me
Sick
White
Unholy
Death
Stab my sorry lungs to hell
Let them suck m y blood
Feel the stench of blasphemy
As I die
Die
Die
Die
Sick
White
Unholy
Death
Do you feel merciless?
Come on let�s fucking see
Feel the stench of blasphemy
As I die
Die
Life is not precious
Take me to death where I belong
Vile and obnoxious
I cannot hide my joy
Or what�s to come
Sick
White
Unholy
Death
Do you feel merciless?
Come on let�s fucking see
The solid mass that once was me
Is still a curse
[Music: Lasse Johansen, Lyrics: Ole J�rgen Moe]
Waste as the seas flood
The religious soil and
Mankind lays in ruin still
We burn with joy
Heed the call the distorted grin
The enlightened has prevailed
Now face the sewer
Spirits die with the written words
Icons scattered in the sea
... The etching cleanser
Cold
Waiting
Grave
Words end...
So come extinction
The ethnic savior
No lies
Hope
Dies
Terrified
The sickened fall
Fall
The mindless weep polluted tears
Preachers vomit human waste
The shapeless crawl in cancer soil
The melting earth still breaths
Heed the call, the distorted grin
The enlightened has prevailed
Now face the sewer
Spirits die with the written words
Icons scattered in the sea
... The etching cleanser
The crawling heart reeks
Like fungus from the soul
The prowling worm seeks
Its grace and its grief
Heart is sworn
And the worm, it licks
Tongue like thorns
And the spit burns holes
Heartworm
Heartworm
The fever aches
Grows with the tainted self
The sweat flows
And paints the inner hell
Heart is sworn
And the worm, it licks
Tongue like thorns
Heart is sworn
And the worm, it licks
Tongue like thorns
The spit burns holes
The fever aches
Grows with the tainted self
The sweat flows
And paints the inner hell
Heart is sworn
And the worm, it licks
Tongue like thorns
Heart is sworn
And the worm, it licks
Tongue like thorns
The spit burns holes
Multinational corporations
Genocide of the starving nations
Advertise the product you make
Never give but always take
Kill and lie for security
Your shit on supermarket shelves to see
Instinct of survival
The multinational corporations
Makes its profit from the starving nations
Indigenous peoples become their slaves
From their births into their graves
The multinational corporations
Makes its profit from the starving nations
Another product for you to buy
You'll keep paying until you die
There's nothing to gain
You have just been led
The kill, after death, the kill
The shit you were promised
Means nothing now you're dead
The kill, after death, the kill
In your mind
Nothing but fear
You can't face life
Or believe death's near
A vision of life
On television screens
An existence created
From empty dreams
Hide behind T.V.
Hide behind life
You should be living
But you only survive
Life holds nothing
But pain and death
Don't look for love
There is none left
Surrounding spectacle
To occupy curiosity
Nullifies the need
To face reality
Forms of escapism
And entertainment
Occupy & disable thought
They not only pollute the air
They pollute our minds
They're destroying the earth
And destroying mankind
Polluted minds
Kill mankind
They don't give a shit
Long as profits are high
They don't give a shit
If people die
Polluted minds
Kill mankind
I've been deceived
By my friends
And this is where
Our "friendship" ends
Sacrificed, sacrificed
Sacrificed, your soul sacrificed
The thoughts I had
Are now denied
And one day soon
I hope you DIE
Siege of power
In your land
Too many problems
For you to understand
Siege of power
Inside your mind
Outward restrictions
To keep you in line
Siege of power - in your land
Too many problems - for you to understand
A slave of their power - you never question why
Your going to suffer - you're going to die
Siege of power - inside your mind
Outward restrictions - to keep you in line
You're a slave of their power - you never questioned why
You were made to suffer - you were born to die
Siege of power
They made you a tool
While others were ruling
You were being ruled
There is a fascist
Inside of you
Controlling your life
And what you do
Fascist control
There is a fascist
Inside your head
Controlling your thoughts
Until your death
Fascist control
Born on your knees
Life in chains
A slow death
Into your graves
Born on your knees
Born on your knees
Life of pain
Existence restricted
By material gains
Born on your knees
You fucking asshole
Born on your knees
Conditioned blind
Crawling to death
Revenge for your crime
Born on your knees
Born on your knees
From the womb torn
Live in chains
And die as you were born
Born on your knees
Paid to obey
Forced to be silent
Human garbage
To be destroyed
Submit to darkness
Forced to conform
Human garbage
To be destroyed
Your mind is dead
Your thoughts are void
Human garbage
To be destroyed
You suffer...
But why?
Brought into this emptiness
Never hope or choice
Emotionless and cold
This is life?
Illusions shattered
An existence of lies
A constant struggle
Freedom denied
At their feet - submission
No sanctuary in death
Drugged up, fucked up
Is that all you're worth?
Trapped - inside your head
Insular, living dead
Existing for a purpose you'll never find
Inducements, distortions command your mind
External sources maintain control
Programmed existence, fulfill your role
You've got a brain, shake off the reins
Smash the shackles, break the chains
Systematic rape of nature
Profit precedes need
Maintaining economic stature
Steal the fruit yet leave no seed
And of future generations?
What of their inheritance
A world of contamination
Poisoned by our ignorance
Oblivious to reality
Conscience spurned
Beyond the point of no return
Nothing I can say
That hasn't already been said
Generic words & thoughts
Similarly expressed
This primitive stance
Feelings of angst
Matters relating
To circumstance
"Unfounded action -
just part of the faction"
Conform? I wouldn't give you
The satisfaction
Climb the ladder, your security
Upward social mobility
Consume the lies "It's what you need"
Vicious circle of mindless greed
Where is your success gained from?
What of the lives you're shat upon?
Caught in the web you'll play the game
An artifical life but who's to blame?
Becoming weary of your lies
You disguise the truth belies
Only fooling yourself
Pretend to bite the hand that feeds
But you won't discard your security
The transparency of your fantasy
Eminent
Arrogant
Ignorant
Affluent
Desensitized
Devoid and blind
All compassion nullified
Paragon of virtue
(Paragon of shit)
Permissive slaves
To their methods of greed
From our needs
The leeches feed
When will you see?
We'll never be free
While we sanction
This plutocracy
Same pre-determinated
Pattern, game, rules
Uniformity
Conformity
How long can you hide the truth
Now you've settled down
Reflected on your past
The pose, the look, the stance
All part of the act
Cleansing impurity
Seizure of insecurity
Divine death
Individuality disabled
Blinded by fables
Divine death
Easy prey
You will pay
Mourn life's loss
Rotting on that cross
Divine death
Hiding behind symbols
Self-delusion
Plenty of questions
(And no solutions)
Visions of change
A mere illusion
Futile dreams
Of revolution
Flows of rhetoric
Won't influence change
Their will is subdued
Their minds enslaved
Bitching
Back-stabbing
Senseless in-fighting
"United we stand
Divided we fall"
The common enemy that overshadows us all
A superiority complex
Pious, holy to the hilt
Outwards displays of cleanliness
Masking inner feelings of hate and guilt
Your morality is hypocrisy
Obsessive self-esteem
Enforcing your ideals
Your puritanical dream
Gather your flock
Gullible fools
Dictate restrictions
Blissfully ignorant
Content and unaware
Not your problem
Why should you care?
Not normal
An easy target for release
Infected from birth
This sickening disease
You sanctimonious slime
Understanding discarded
The truth is clear
It's you that's retarded
Stark, bleak, wasted
Devastated
When?
All life
Totally annihilated
Die!
Does it have to be this way
Is this the price we're gonna pay?
The ascension of human intelligence
To atomic genocide
Homo Sapiens = the disease the cause the pollution
Erase the aeons of evolutions
Pushed too far, just a matter of time
Seemingly nothing to halt the tide...
...Except the end - accept the end?
As I skulked past the gates
And drew behind the stones
The winding trees enveloped
The cloak around my bones
Peering through the night's mist
I crept through the fen
To try and find the totem
In the grey warg's den
The freezing forest guards
The secrets that he wrought
His spirit lies on every twig
His scent infests the haunt
His howling cut the still air
His cry up to the stars
The piercing bay of his rage
Tore the beat out of my heart
To the entrance
I stalked up in the shadows
His breathing I could hear
Rasping in the barrows
Silently my dagger slid
From its ice-cracked sheath
His bloody maw emerging
His jowls hung raw beneath
Like those that lusted below me
My mind was always snared
The totem drew my senses
The grey warg drew my fear
His giblet eyes surveyed me
His haggard haunch was raised
Rearing up his splintered paw
He struck me in a daze
And with his jaws jarred open
he tore me on the floor
as lonely bones forgotten now
I lay here evermore
I knew you some years before
Deep in prayer under bough
Futile sighs in vital skin
Your flesh caressed by night
Yet change came quickly
A bruise in the air, it staggered within
Sweet sickly rot
Black wound infection
King, slave, child
Your fates are united
An unending row to the grave
A single dance now, all eyes are shut
Blind to the earthly
Begging now to forget who I am
Emperor, your sword is useless
Shattered crowns so swiftly
Fragile as the scythe
Aching bones cling to swollen limbs
Despair floods all senses
The world is dying around me
Gaping in mirth, his old eyes spoke
Where you are now - I once was
And what I am now - you soon will be
Nothingness awaits you
Begging now to regain what I've lost
The tale of life is but a picture
A flash in an abyss, a dream in the void
See that there is no meaning,
Understand eternal death
You long now to try what you once feared
But the time is gone and dust will be your legacy
In death she spoke of waiting
Her final days were long
These fields have changed since last she wept
Before the silent throng
She sits where childhood memories lie
Above, beside, within them
The carvings have outlived the hand
Which bled to first begin them
As features of the landscape merge
The oldest trees are falling
Awareness sweeps the view aside
She stares as if recalling
Seen first beyond the canopy
They soon had reached the borders
The clouds infused with burning breath
Arrived from coldest corners
The windswept valley hastens now
As dying words are uttered
From lips of earth and sapling's strain
Like leaves, her last thoughts fluttered
Again it darkens overhead
The knowledge of it stills me
And when the water starts to fall
Preserve the drop that kills me
Descending through thickened mist
An old man reached inside and tore out my slumber
Ivory twists an open claw
Set upon the skulls of man
Formative years aside
Truth blanched in sun's delusion
But providence affirmed
Destroyed my aberration
Mortal seeds in divine
Gave grief into life's form
And so curved the spine
Obeisance made before him
Blessed in life but truly cursed by death
Bitter choice befalls you
Glory, lord of men, asks but pain
Master's stone was weaved
Compelled before the throne
Then war came, a semblance of her
Lands unite and he prospers
Grand signs assail me
Temptation yields assent
As irons carve the sand
A ruse brings fate upon him
Anguished price for laurels
Veins burnt by hatred,
In premonitions menis consumed me
Unsanctified, I cared nothing for their ways
Yet a father's plea dragged mercy from me
Now, demi-god, echo in eternity
A toxic toll pierces the flaw
On reflection, there was never any choice
Through tainted mass
A scourge unseen
Brought three winters forth
And set between
After these hundreds of years
The embers and fate will collide
Her rotten heart has burst
And shattered through dead wood
When they drank from the earth, the end was near
Tracing paths that once ran alone and pure
Suffused within, the blighted decay
Now snapped into dust, their splinters fall
But a tithe to the wind, his frail grasps
Clawed for the moon then came undone
When all hope fails in the last broken bough
Her strength will be gone
Churning ash and husks in the bitter winds
Crack the earth and burn the sky
A wry procession of hubris
Where nothing remains
But everything changes...
In destruction she will create
Arising in glory, the searing gaze
Crimson-handed specter of death
Under the blood eye of furies
Bury their feeble hearts
Name the aspect of oblivion
That instilled in you such dread
In the moment that was waiting
Where the causal chain had led
Describe the pure finality
Of that twisted, cold eruption
And attempt to comprehend
Unparalleled destruction
Unclench your teeth and meet your demise
Behold the fate you always desired
Standing on the brink, we see our home is lost
A sacrifice led to the slaughter
Black flickers grit the cusp
Hands clasped under falling soil
Drip down faintly by dark whispers
A torrent into madness
Blunt nails shred the life from your face
Fetid strips of decaying hope
Drift down gently
In obsidian water
Your pale arms reach for me
Beckon me closer
In silence at last
A peace we always wanted
We cease to be
Countless times below me
Rivers rose and fell
Ageless stones eroding out
Across the endless swell
Songs to pave the seasons
Wounds to follow birth
Cries to carry through the night
Wombs to feed the earth
Countless skies above me
Each unlike the next
Lines of more than moon and sun
Glimpses of a text
Countless hands have sought me
Reaching out in vain
Permanence observes without
Compassion or disdain
Flames to greet the harvest
Storms to face in awe
Winds to weave through every wood
Walls to dull the road
Purpose lost to frailty
Craning blades of grass
Strength and weakness on and on
All that is will pass
Countless hands have sought me
Reaching out in vain
Permanence observes without
Compassion or disdain
Flames to greet the harvest
Storms to face in awe
Winds to weave through every wood
Walls to dull the road
Countless waves around me
Strong until the last
Leaning into dimming dreams
All that was has passed
The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived and he...
He paid a visit to his brother and then he...
He walked on down the hall, yeah
And he came to a door
And he looked inside
Father? Yes son? I want to kill you
He said what?
And mother? I want to...
I want to fuck you
For what you put me through
So what you got
So fuck you
It's coming back to you
So what you got
The other night I was out riding in a friend's car
And out there on the side of the road
There was this snake
This snake had eyes of fire and fangs from another world
But he was selling something
He was selling devotion
He was selling dreams, he was selling lifestyles
And I said sure man what you got
I'm interested in anything that's gonna get me off
And the snake just stood there and smiled with the spit in his eye and cried
Fuck you
For what you put me through
So what you got
So fuck you
It's coming back to you
So what you got
He was selling dreams and he was selling lies
I met the prisoner of my own device
He was selling love, he was selling bliss
He sold me anything, I could not resist
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
I had the freedom to live how I wanted
To take what I wanted to take
From anyone at any time
Forever in heartache
As the snake just stood there and smiled
At my demise
I wasn't scared
So fuck you
For what you put me through
So what you got
So fuck you
For what you put me through
So what you got
How many people can I hate in my mind
With an intention of murder
Have the people fear me
The people bleeding
Once they're conditioned, it's easy to provoke aggression
This premonition is evil
Killing begets more killing
The blood lust begins
Killing begets more killings
The blood lust begins
What kind of visions can I build in my mind
To harvest the hearts of the people
To create the fever you need a reason
Once they're conditioned, it's easy to provoke aggression
This premonition is evil
Killing begets more killing
The blood lust begins
Killing begets more killing
The blood lust begins
It makes me feel alive in my eyes
It makes all the pain subside
Just out after sunset
I take a walk down the streets
Ya know, try to clear the head
And I feel like I gotta put my fist upon the wall
Feel the cold concrete as it tears apart my knuckles
Take it, feel it, you freak
Take it, feel it, you freak
I feel I'm breaking down
Take it, feel it, you freak
I feel...
Take it, feel it, you freak
I feel I'm fucking up
Take it, feel it, you freak
I can't get out
Take it, feel it
The world's fucked up and we lit the fuse
It's all used up, what you gonna do
There's a devil in the desert, there's a devil on the TV
There's a devil in the mirror and it's fucking with me
Motherfucker
The worlds will collide
A fire from the sky
The afterlife will await you
The man on the TV is all you need to see
Well freedom is our message but money is the key
Media is a weapon selling fear and deception
Painting propaganda and disbelief
Load another fucking round
The worlds will collide
A fire from the sky
Murder
Shut the fuck up
Murder
Keep the public busy so they'll never see
Keep them so busy that they're full of greed
Never ask a question and never ask why
Ship em to the desert now watch them die
Motherfucker
The worlds will collide
A fire from the sky
Burn it down
It's a production of fear
Take another look isn't it clear
It's all so sadistic, annihilistic, it's so fucking vicious
It's getting harder to feel for all the people I kill
No time to cry for those who died
They stay unjustified
Through these eyes I see the catastrophe lying in my wake
Voices inside my mind shiver my spine
I am not ashamed
Look at me I'm a dead man walking
Put another nail in the coffin
On the hill I see the bodies burning
Burn it down
Looking back at the fields, all the blood that I've spilt
There's no emotion, just destruction of another person
Look at the blood on my hands
I feel no pain in my heart
Take a paxil, take a xanax
It won't erase the memories
Through these eyes I have seen such misery
I am not afraid
And if I should die tonight that would be just fine
Lay me in my grave
Look at me I'm a dead man walking
Put another nail in the coffin
On a hill I see the bodies burning
False evidence appearing real
So superficial, so superficial
She's like the young white rabbit with bloodshot eyes
Dreaming of another place inside it's mind
Well it's a lonely place that houses the suffering and feeds the pain
So what would you do for fifteen minutes of fame
Out on your own
Some friends are out to get you
Some out to do you harm
She's been chasing dragons for endless nights
So afraid to live and yet afraid to die
Well it's a lonely place that houses the suffering and feeds the pain
So what would you do for fifteen minutes of fame
Out on your own
Some friends are out to get you
Some out to do you harm
Another night
Just another night
Some friends are out to get you
Some out to do you harm
Retribution is a pleasure,
We won't beat your fucking hate,
I've been looking around,
Some people can't be found,
It seem they are locked in a solitude,
It's hard to get by,
All the head full of doubt,
To take possible positive attitude,
Heart scarred...On the top,
All clawed...is life
It's a fight to the top of the system son,
So suck it up and be a man,
Before your vision is dead,
Retribution is a pleasure,
we won't beat your fucking hate,
All though the faces may change,
The song remains the same,
Is how you deal with the gratitude,
Always get kicks in the blood when begin,
And I will show all you folks how it is to lose,
Heart scarred...On the top,
All clawed...is life
It's a fight to the top of the system son,
So suck it up and be a man,
Before your vision is dead,
No... It's gone...
I'm feeling right,
I'm feeling fine,
One, two, one, two, three, four
Desperate Cries In The Hour Of Vengeance

I take my first taste of freedom and I've never felt so alive. Yeah.
And out of the corner of my eye I see a woman,
Well she was more radiant than I ever could have imagined.
And she was singing: "what's wrong with you!"
What is the problem with drinking whiskey and smoking weed.
Live within the system, if you don't like it then fucking leave.
Well get me back, get me back on the road.
I met the devil and I sold my soul.
'Cause everything and everyone is old. (hey hey hey)
I cut my lung out, I need a fix.
You're my puzzle and my pieces fit
'Cause everything and everyone is old. (hey hey hey)
The nights in the desert paint pictures that aren't always what they seem.
The dust kicking up all around, it makes this shit come on like a whirl wind.
And she stands up on the hood of my car
And she screams to all my team and says: "MURDERER!"
I wanna see chaos, wanna see victims be one with the pain.
The power of our redemption supresses the memories of tragedy.
Oh, give me what I need.
Let me drift away.
Where are the troubles, all my troubles are so far away.
Well get me back, get me back on the road.
I met the devil and I sold my soul.
'Cause everything and everyone is old. (hey hey hey)
I cut my lung out, I need a fix.
You're my puzzle and my pieces fit
'Cause everything and everyone is old. (hey hey hey)
Well get me back, get me back on the road.
I met the devil and I sold my soul.
'Cause everything and everyone is old. (hey hey hey)
I cut my lung out, I need a fix.
You're my puzzle and my pieces fit
'Cause everything and everyone is old. (hey hey hey)
Everyone is so comprimised, that they will never be (the chosen ones)
You all feel like you've been put down. You've all been fuckin' compromised. You've all been sold. Your soul is ruined.
How does it feel to be numbered? And to be one in a million? Just another statistic in failure.
Once again you are compromised, enslaved, spineless. Cut off from something else, someone else. Living off somebody else's dream. Somebody else's hard work. The one that compromised.
How does it feel? How does it feel to be numbered?
Weapons engaged,
The satellites have their position,
The threat is imminent,
We have proof and probable cause,
Strike and we shall be victorious.
Let the killing begin,
Here's where the killing begins.
Your orders are clear to search and destroy,
Leave nothing alive,
Women and children are collateral damage,
In keeping them nothing can be gained,
To destroy them is no loss at all.
Let the killing begin,
Here's where the killing begins.
No there ain't no hope,
There is no feeling left in this heart of stone,
And so it goes, set to explode,
We are the killing machine set to unload.
We now reserve the right to invade your homes and,
Seize your properties, and search your persons at will...
Meanwhile your ports are a gaping hole,
The casualties will be enormous.
Let the killing begin,
Here's where the killing begins.
No there ain't no hope,
There is no feeling left in this heart of stone,
And so it goes, set to explode,
We are the killing machine set to unload.
Now that you're surrounded,
And cut off from all support,
The nemesis rises as the targets acquired,
And you look upon the sky and pray,
To the gods above...
To the gods above...
No there ain't no hope,
There is no feeling left in this heart of stone,
And so it goes, set to explode,
We are the killing machine set to unload.
I wanna wake up with a reason to celebrate, I wanna wake up before it's too late
I wanna hear that song on the radio
Spinning around my head like a halo
As I fade to another place where I dream while I'm still awake
I feel shame as I waste away
I sip this cheap champagne
It's just another day
Hey, old man, you used to live for the heroin
You were a shooting star leaving impressions
Now you're sitting alone in your rocking chair
Wishing you could rock it right out of there
As I fade to another place
Where I dream while I'm still awake
I feel shame as it waves away
I see think that she's still blind
It's just another day
It's hopeless, devotion, it drags me down and weighs a thousand pounds
How can this be true?
I have been denied, denied...
We're all afraid to die
We are living a lie
Bring on the endless night
Bring on the afterlife
We're all afraid to die
We are living a lie
Bring on the endless night
Bring on oblivion
Oblivion
We're all afraid to die
We are living a lie
Bring on the endless night
Bring on the afterlife
We're all afraid to die
We are living a lie
Bring on the endless night
Bring on oblivion
Oblivion
We're all afraid to die
We are living a lie
Bring on the endless night
Bring on the afterlife
We're all afraid to die
We are living a lie
Bring on the endless night
Bring on oblivion
These times they mean so much it's all about love and family.
No one can ever hold us down.
No one can ever hold us back.
Stuck it out through all the hardships, but troubled times have come our way but in the end we'll prevail.
I accept the challenge to change our destiny, Gouge out your eyes, and judge us blind.
We refuse to take your judgements and your lies.
The lives you've turned away will be your true demise.
But this is something you will not take from me, it's in my heart forever.
FOREVER.
And now the time has come for us to rise again, too bad it came to this... settle the score.
You've only got one life make sure you do it right.
No promises for the future no promise for tonight.
When you're gone there's no coming back, make sure you leave here knowing that His love is the only way.
Not doing anything about it is a choice, being a good person won't do.
But accepting the pain and burden carried for you.
Sin is life and life is sin.
Knowing your forgiven for it comes from within.
Living and dying with the choices you've made.
Save us oh God, from the enemy that strikes on sight.
Save me from myself oh God as I lay down to sleep tonight.
Let me rest in your arms as I take my last breath.
Let me rest in your arms tonight as I take my last breath of life.
Let me rest in your arms.
Let me rest in your arms tonight.
As I take my last breath.
As I take my last breath of life.
And we've worked so hard over the years to get where we are.
Now there's no turning back so we'll keep on keepin' on.
Some said we wouldn't amount to anything but we're here to prove you wrong and good things come to those who wait....
Never stopping until it's over always fighting this endless battle.
And all the choices that we've made are left behind.
The promise of truth isn't hard to reach in and find.
But we're falling apart can't you see the truth that's always been lying right here in plain sight for you to see.
ONE FIGHT!
Put on your armour, fight for your life.
I didn't think that it would come to this, I never thought what we had would end this way.
I gave and all you did was take from me, this was nothing but a game to you.
But I refuse to live in the past.
I'm moving on to better things than you.
With you I was weak but now my strength, it is renewed.
This game you played is over now.
Never again will I mistake lust for love.
This game you played with my heart is over now.
So as I lay down to sleep tonight, I will pray that you find what you're looking for but my seeking is over, for I have returned to my true First Love.
My eyes wander in their blindness.
My eyes consume truth.
Take this time to decide my beliefs and stay true.
Take this time to look inside my heart and find.
If you look among the masses, you will find that sex lust lies and greed only bring pain.
Just remember where your heart lies and never let it fail or die.
My God, I'm Yours.
The time had come to make the ultimate sacrifice, the bitter cup would not be removed.
Through betrayal and denial you never said a word.
As the flesh was ripped from your back, you never said a word.
As you walked to your execution you saw man at his worst.
Your silence spoke volumes and your path was unshaken.
Thorns embedded in flesh, sweat burning open wounds.
Tortured by the ones you were dying for.
Hammer to nail.
Nail to flesh.
Blood flowing crimson red to was white.
With dying breath, asking forgiveness for our murders.
All this for a world of imperfection and sin.
All for a world who would deny your existence.
A world that could never deserve grace and mercy.
But yours abounds, unending love for an unworthy world.
This one goes out to my friends, family.
The ones that have been there through thick and thin.
Being true and standing tall, helping me pick myself up whenever I fall.
Family extends farther than blood, having my back when push comes to shove.
A forever bond that can't be broken.
The words I've said couldn't go unspoken.
I make this vow to you my friends, we'll stick this out until the bitter end.
Nothing will ever break our tie, my life for yours... no greater love have I.
Our friendship will stand the test of time.
Your life is nothing but a shadow of your lies, come on rip off your disguise and realize.
That you always gotta push forward.
Perfect sinful disease, sickness, it eats us.
Always progress, never reject.
Scars are here to show me what's next.
This is a war, this is a fight that I may sleep when I lay tonight.
Where will it be?
Struggle to see all that is left in store for me.
Let us forget where we were at and all that is holding us back.
Holding us back.
And everytime I turned away from you and everytime your faithfulness proved true.
Evil days keep plaguing my whole life but this time I think I'm ready for this life, I know I'm ready for the fight.
We will set this world ablaze.
Everyone has the chance to make a difference, everyone has a chance to change.
When you retrace the steps of your life, will you have used every opportunity given?
Mediocrity is a choice that you must not make.
Take your chance to make a change, be an example of what's within.
Live what you preach and preach what you live.
Let your words be the spark but let your actions be the flame that will burn the truth into the world.
Don't let your silence be a tool for the enemy.
Always speak the truth.
And with the flame of the truth burning within our hearts we will set this world ablaze.
Don't confuse taste for truth our blood still burns like fire.
Don't get caught up in the way we rock, it's just a ruse to get us close to you.
Don't be startled by the way we rock. We tear down walls, New York to Cedar Falls.
Soon you will see the there is no one truth, trust us, this is not a game.
Prepare, end is coming soon, the judgement of the strong and weak, judgement of the strong and weak.
Fade away into another reality, fall asleep, wake up and smell the agony.
Dead where you stand.
Since I was a child, I saw my own way,
Who is god and who is not.
I'm so sick of hearing you preach about heaven,
All this bullshit about paradise,
Read all the signs...
The Christians must be stopped
From spreading all the lies,
The only way to get to them,
Without fear, when the sun is a god
Have mercy
It's the ending... of your life.
As my mind slips away,
I see no end of this misery,
The only truth is myself,
I can't go on this way
No!
Read all the signs
You're the sign
Are you forgetting
To the end of the rainbow,
My own
All alone I know... won't I'll be there...
NO!!
With a stab in the back,
Have mercy,
It's the end.... of your life
When the son is the path,
Have mercy.
It's the ending of your life.
Out they come to your rescue,
To drag you off the street
They gave you food and shelter
They'll leave you to bleed
They'll take all your money
Destroy all your goals
They're killing for religion
Then go lookin' for more
Wretched scum of the earth
They are waiting for rebirth
A relief from this labor
But they need a slave to do the work
You want an answer
They will use you 'til you die
They'll brainwash and convince you
That you will end up in Paradise
The day is old
They see through your mind, too
Down and out
You can't see up out of the gloom
Another way to bullshit the youth
To burn all the lies
They fill you up with this bullshit
They will make you lie
Then they'll cover the earth
They are waiting for rebirth
A relief from this labor
But they need a slave to do the work
You want an answer
They will use you 'til you die
They'll brainwash and convince you
That you will end up in Paradise
Ah
Wretched scum of the earth
They are waiting for rebirth
A relief from this labor
But they need a slave to do the work
You want an answer
They will use you 'til you die
They'll brainwash and convince you
You will end up in Paradise
Liars
You feel the warning
From behind
The truth is buried in a wall of time
Threw the sorrows of your life
You ain't getting ahead from this Christ
I feel an evil approaching me
The voices calling me on
Silence
The only sound is the knife through the air
Hell
Is where I'll be when I'm through with you
I give up my needs
To get ahead
Cut and ripped through your clothes again
Cut wide open
To drink the wounds
You feel the power of no remorse
I feel an evil approaching me
The voices calling me on
Silence
The only sound is the knife through the air
Hell
Is where I'll be when I'm through with you
Silence
The only sound is the knife through the air
Hell
Is where I'll be when I'm through with you
I'm drinking from the Sea of Death
For the solution

Walk there in my name

To live a traitor

Take my body and make me burn

Demons of hell will arise

Freedom is death
Freedom is death
Death

Eternal life

I will make you suffer
Rise from the depths of hell
Destroying all that's good
Crush Christians and let Satan loose
Spread your wings
And give us a sign
Let us know the time is here
End of religion, torture, love and sacrifice and fear
The true believers will only survive
The real freedom
The rest will die
The path will lead me back
The way back to darkness
In hell I'll stay
To fulfill my long command
Whoever will never ??? again
Will prove how ???
They'll walk back on the path
The path with the ones
When Solomon is here
The earth will be like a desert
Hell will rise from the sand

The real freedom
The rest will die
The path will lead me back
The path back to Babylon
In hell, I'll stay
To fulfill my long command
Ah
I am alive to make you pay
I am alive to take your life
For thirty years I've waited
Finally, the time is here
Hunting you down and destroy you
For betraying me
Lying about your religion
Hereby, I sentence to death
Don't you ever be preachin'
About the things you don't understand
Reach for eternal fire
Reach for the death
Betray the liar
I capture your soul
I'll cut your arms and legs
So you can't get away
Your blood now will pour through your ???
Won't you let me go
Your scream will give me pleasure
To see you suffer

The betrayer paid in blood
You want me

Kill for blood
Kill for blood
Beware of the north wind
It will take you away
Put you to sleep
Terrified
Swept up your body
You will be left to rot with the leaves
You will stop breathing
As you pass away
Suffocate
Your skin turns blue
The eye:
The eyeballs roll in the back of your head
The north wind will pick you up
And take you on a journey to hell
Wind of evil swept over the earth
Kills all the living souls
Cult of Cold
Gather 'round for the storms
Worship them,
Watching them do the works of evil
The earth will be dark as death
No existence of life
Death, cold and emptiness
You will stop breathing
As you pass away
Suffocate
Your skin turns blue
Your time will come to face the truth
You only live to die, to die in pain
People like you, you were only meant to suffer
For a ??? of your own state of mind
Wandering right through
You make me puke – bljuvat'
You prefer ??? to die
You remain in your own bile - gorcina
Though always
??? way to be
???
Where will you go now?
??? of torture
We're coming up to offer
You know in the end you will suffer
Rise, king of hell
???
No one will care
What do you do with your life?
As my soul leaves the body
On a free ticket to hell
To a floating unknown
For a vision of you all my life
The impression reaches my soul
As I see my destiny
A panic goes through my mind
As I see myself slowly die
Wake me up from this nightmare
I cry out "Make it stop!"
Get me back in my body
I'll never, never leave it again
Never trust your own instincts
On a journey to hell
I can't leave my body lying
Like this
I try to reach out
And grab it
And wake myself up
Oh, God!
I feel a pity
For all that died
Cause I'm stuck here, in hell
Wake me up from this nightmare
I cry out "Make it stop!"
Get me back in my body
I'll never, never leave it again
Never trust your own instincts
On a journey to hell
As the full moon rised
In the sky, it awakes
Master, bring out the dark
Forces upon me
I live for dying
And to kill
Watcher, open the Gates of Death
Reach for the silence
Reach for the death
[digipack only]
Tortured in flames
For my belief
That will take me to hell
One step closer to death
I release my anger to be free
[Monk-style chanting:] (Feel alone again)
I feel no guilt for the lost ones
I'll strangle and suffocate
[more chanting]
I look around and see all the pain gone
(Feel alone again)
Legions of world domination
These bastards came with a method of hate
Suicide, the end; prayer for death
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Armageddon, our earth they cast away
The ghost of the devil has cursed us from here
The angels cry and run in vain
Satan's victory, earth will stand inflamed
Oh, the holocaust is falling in
Legions of world domination
Your killings always burning black
Murder and the sky turns red
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn crosses upside down
Yeah, so that we see the sign.
Walk with me through the flame
Teach this world; things it's done
What we say; burning down
Evil world; have no life
Just choose death to come in the light
It's the teacher's way
Here we go!
The angels cry and run in vain
Satan's victory, earth will stand inflamed
The holocaust is falling in
Legions of world domination
The angels cry and run in vain
Satan's victory, earth will stand inflamed
The holocaust is falling in
Legions of world domination
Try to run and hide
They'll get you.
The shadows arrive
Now, it's too late
Blinded by God
The hell, man, is here
Ooh, millions died in vain
Time is running out
There is no way to escape
And you chose the pain
Whoa!
Priests, pagans,
And faith; they're dead
Ooh, nothing will be the same again
Blinded by God
The hell, man, is here
Ooh, millions died in vain
Time is running out
There is no way to escape
And you chose the pain
No escape
Hold the cross; death is near
Burn the cross; The end is here
Bloody death
The hell, man, is here
Ooh, millions died in vain
Time is running out
There is no way to escape
And you chose the pain
A thousand kills and I' m back again
To give the earth a big chill
My many faces just a trick, a disguise
To fool you into my trap
Nowhere between
I am the devil
I will control your mind
So let's begin
You'll feel my anger
A new creation of me
An event you'll know by seals
It ain't here
I am the falling angel
You beware
And your sin grows depth with pride
Hell is here
I am the king,
I'll take your heart on your grave
I'll do whatever it takes to win
To get control of your life
I'll show you things that you would never believe
And then you will be mine
Nowhere between
I am the devil
I will control your mind
So let's begin
You'll feel my anger
A new creation of me
An event you'll know by seals
It ain't here
I am the falling angel
You beware
And their sin grows depth with time
Hell is here
I am the king,
I'll take your heart on your grave
I have created...
In my visions, part of you see your ??? for your own
The ??? populace runs for your cult
You never seem to get what you gave up
You made a prison of your faith
Just before you pass away
Entrapping your mind in your box
For me, it's a consequence I'll deny
Oh, I'm squeezing in
Oh, I'm deep in guts
Oh, I remove your skin
Oh, I'll never stop
Bye, bye
I'll put your head beside me
So you can see me reform in your blood
Your skin becomes an angel
And fuckin' worshipped as God
Your son decided to go with me
But, there's nothing much left of you
Thanks for standing beside me,
Now I'm through with you
Oh, I'm squeezing in
Oh, I'm deep in guts
Oh, I remove your skin
Oh, it could never stop
Oh, I'm squeezing in
Oh, I'm deep in guts
Oh, I remove your skin
Oh, I'll never stop
Yeah!
Another victim of violence
A new era of hate
Is coming your way
On different levels of pain
Who will be saved?
Radio controls your mind
Get on-line
I' m on your screen
Skinned from behind
Make you writhe
I am your digital god
A new generation of religion
I am your digital god
Coming to get you
A new dimension of messiah
Accept and move below
I am god
Erase away yesterday
And live with the program
Brainwashed minds
And stay on the line
Now your brain is fried
I am god
Radio controls your mind
Get on-line
I' m on your screen
Skinned from behind
Make you writhe
I am your digital god
A new generation of religion
I am your digital god
Yeah!
Like a fire in the sky,
They came to earth
To put the life on the run,
To hide and observe
Basic destruction and chaos
People running for their life
Secret abduction for their research
You can scream but you can' t hide
Running from the shadow
Can I ever be free?
Struggling for my life
What do they want from me?
The invasion of your private life
Has only begun
A light has split the sky
There' s nowhere to run
They don' t care what you're feeling
They only do what has to be done
Running from the shadow
Can I ever be free?
Struggling for my life
What do they want from me?
Lying on a cold bed
Faces hard to see
Wake me up and take me away
So I can breathe
Running from the shadow
Can I ever be free?
Struggling for my life
What do they want from me?
Lying on a cold bed
Faces hard to see
Wake me up and take me away
So I can breathe
Though hate is a blackened art,
May your eyes all be upon me
Open me up to take the life
Forever, I'll be free
Cults are on my mind
Rise into the sky
A usurping sun
It will be the final eclipse
Drowned in the Red Sea
Rivers are running wild
Delusions become hunting souls
Just the thing to set us off
God has been denied
Universal genocide
In pain we will lie
Creation of the demon sky
The god of the fire is born
To come and take control
Nothing is left behind
Mortal we are the earth
Now, you're dead and gut upside down
Hell is folding in
The fiend are rising from the ashes
We will take their dead
Take their dead
Cults are on my mind
Rise into the sky
A usurping sun
It will be the final eclipse
God has been denied
Universal genocide
The pain, we lie
Creation of the demon sky
Since the day you were born
You always dreamed of a normal life
But disease that now it's been out on you
Oh, you can't take it no more
Forgive me for doing this
It hurts me more to see your life
But, for your own good,
You must die
Good-bye, my love
I'm taking your life
Ripping you from me
To slowly slip away
I'm putting your sick body to sleep
So you can have a peace of mind
Good-bye, my love
Killing you with my bare hands
You try to put up with a fight
As I try to squeeze your throat
Looking at me, eyes wide
Blood's squirting out
Father gives, the father takes
To decide it's the child's fate
Good-bye, my love
I' m taking your life
Sparing you the pain
To slowly dream away
I'm putting your sick body to sleep
So you can have a peace of mind
Good-bye, my love
Killing you with my bare hands
I'm holding your body
My mind is so overwhelmed
Don't cry for me not yet!
Good-bye, my love
I'm taking your life
Sparing you the pain
To slowly dream away
I'm putting your sick body to sleep
So you can have a peace of mind
Good-bye, my love
Killing you with my hands
Good-bye, my love
Good-bye, my love
Good-bye, my love

Cut of the holy knife
Sodomized for the ritual
Ancients of the light
Barely forgotten
I am no savior
And I ain't no saint
They will take me to the electric chair
Yeah, Ha ha ha
No remorse
And no regrets
For those I've sent straight to hell
I have my demons
They're all here in my cell
They're all here and follow me everywhere
My hate controls me
And gives me strength
My only protection inside the walls
Dying. Desiring. Crying. Dying.
Dying. Desiring. Crying. Dying.
The walls are closing in
My cell is getting smaller
Soon, all the pains must cease
Life will end here
My final days are coming
I can wash away this pain
My body's getting colder
Oh, I feel so unafraid
Dying. Desiring. Crying. Dying.
Dying. Desiring. Crying. Dying.
The walls are closing in
My cell is getting smaller
Soon, all the pains must cease
Life will end here
My final days are counting
I can wash away this pain
My body's getting colder
Oh, I feel so unafraid
On death row.
Can't imagine the pain inside of you.
Can't take the violence shooting through.
Unleash your rage, pounding fear into their eyes
Neuroses piercing through your head. Again and again.
Can't take the fuckin' pain.
Bury your dead
No remorse for the victims massacred.
There's no end to this twisted killing spree.
Now come to terms with the rage that blinds your eyes
Transparent, forced-on guilt.
Won't reconcile.
Their distorted values
Fucks your pride.
Appease your fevered mind
Recoil from self-possession.
Set things straight one last time:
Bury your dead.
Tampering with the codes to our existense.
The blasphemy will take its toll.
With blood on their hands, they alter our perception of reality.
Morticians clad in white seek their prey.
Compassion is left behind.
In their search for a controllable mind.
Trespassing on sacred realms.
Sustaining the dying breed.
They will eradicate the features of man's weaknesses.
Delete, improve the versions of ourselves.
Try to cure us from the disease, we're dethroned and left to bleed.
Human nature's shedding skin.
We're all just shedding skin...
Creating but bitter repercussions.
We're disarmed of all control.
With blood on their hands, they alter our perception of reality.
Morticians clad in white seek their prey.
My future is forged with an axe.
I set the pace for you to follow.
Trade my illusions for your rebellion.
The shit I serve you just swallow.
Honed to perfection.
Now watch me escalate your flawless life.
I am sucking you dry, just feed me.
...sucking you dry, just live for me.
There's no end to the secrets I pour into your
hate-polluted veins.
Now I'll drain the fetus that I grew in you
Bred for abuse
Now watch me dominate your pathetic life
[Rep. Chorus]
Like a greedy pig I wallow
I realize all truths are lost
Easily fooled you all will follow.
Like a leech I'll drain you all.
Just feed me
You'll die for me
Once again I've lost my way.
Going nowhere fast, I dread the return.
Spend my days in this self-made cage.
Where my soul can dwell,
and my loneliness is thriven far to well.
All and none of the answers I've found.
Alone I stand on hollow ground.
Too many years have passed.
Too much blood has been spilt.
I realize it's my destiny, my will.
Things aren't always what they seem
As the scars on my skin will show
On hollow ground I stand
On hollow ground repent
The sins were mine. I'm gone, I know.
Dazed and weakened by the haze.
Went nowhere fast, I dread the return.
I've lost my ways, am I losing my mind?
Maybe then my redemtion's there to find.
As an outlet for oppression,
and as a tool for control,
Icons of a sterile creed have come to rule man's destiny.
In the guise of self-made saviuors
They've tried to enslave us all,
But these holy chains of imprisonment will be shattered
by the death of god.
Encircled by a deceitful light,
You escape the harsh reality.
Live sheltered from the awful truths
You internalize the lies of a dead revelation.
Within the iron gates of fate,
They send their lambs to certain death.
Control, kill, justify
You've internalized their lies of a fake revelation.
You buy redemtion, they crush your pride
And feed your mind with visions spawned by fools.
Conjuring up the demons from the fiery pits of hell.
Slithering serpents of the underworld release their
black worm seed.
Enthralled by the falling star, watch the
daylight fail.
Impelled by twisted vengeance, fortify the armies
of the dead.
Brooding Darkness spreads his wings.
The usurper of the throne.
The world burns in penal fire.
Awakening the spirits of the dead.
The world turns, forged in fire.
Rising..the souls of the damned.
Ravished by the malice, which exceeds your darkest dreams.
Embraced by a sulphur sky, take leave of your mortal flesh.
All life expired.
Our visions dead.
All hope expired.
Fortify the armies of the dead.
Pray for me. Pray for my soul beyond redemption.
Pray for my piss-soaked heart, for the hands that
mould my life so shallow.
So shallow
Painted, smiling face
So hollow
Self inflicted pain
Noisome life come cut me and bleed me dry.
Rape me. Rape my mind. Rape what's left of me.
Repulsive abuse yet filled with such desire.
Desire
Painted, smiling face
Such desire
Now watch me fall from grace.
Gagged, violated, forgotten.
Now watch me fall from grace.
My psyche ripped and torn.
Infested - my soul burns.
Abandoned - my mind churns.
Human debris, twitching violently.
I carry hate in every vein, my psyche ripped and torn.
Painful struggle: (you're) tangled in my web.
Hogtied and worn like a crown on my head.
A notion to move is a motion to burn.
Dare a spark into flames, then roasted they'll learn.
You know there's nowhere to escape
It's carved in stone I own your fate
Mute aggression, perpetuate...silencer.
A non-believer will be pistol whipped
Dropped in the hole then endlessly ripped
You better step back, you better toe the line
Don't twitch or stray, don't you fall behind.
Excessive appetite to capitalize
Another set of morals to realize
Face down, pinned to the ground
It's all justified and sound
Know your place and bow down
What's good for me is good for you
You better accept the facts as true.
Gag the suspects who speak their own mind
The truth is what I say, and not what you find
With a firing-squad's diplomacy
Show state-of-art insincerity.
You know there's nowhere to escape
It's carved in stone, I own your fate
Your dependency I advocate
Silencer.
Desensitized. A living scar.
The Painful darkness shrouds my mind.
I've gazed into my deformed self:
Tormented and set ablaze.
Under the surface - there are wounds that never heal.
Under the surface - where the demons take control.
So numb and cold. A living void.
Strife, fight, regain control to end this agony.
I've gazed into my deformed self:
Tormented and set ablaze.
Cannot ease this pain called living.
Something inside me has died.
I succumb to the pain.
Fighting this long-lost battle.
Struggling in vain.
Something within me has died.
I succumb to the dark.
Drain the life blood from my veins,
Ease this pain called living
Save me. I've served my time in hell.
Cleanse me. Release me from the pain.
Bludgeoned and battered. Tears trickle from your mind.
Gaping wounds from the razor-sharp attack.
Something is pulling me down.
A final descent.
Victimized.
A trail of crimson from your eyes.
Eternal scourge.
I crucify your hope.
Violated - struggling in the cold.
Aggrevated - I'm the thorn in your side.
Something is pulling me down.
Too late to repent.
Victimized.
A trail of crimson from your eyes.
Eternal scourge.
I crucify your hope.
Victim iced.
A trail of crimson from your eyes.
A simple murder won't satisfy my taste for death.
Surge of hatred. You drown in the darkness of my eyes.
Razor-sharp desire cutting deep.
The excitement shivers down my spine.
Souls, damned and deserted.
Waiting for the lord to call. Sheep
who lost their shepherd, Your God
deceived you all. Look who he left
in charge. The ill-conceived bastard
son. Left to die on the cross.
For what, for whom? I am all sins
God Puppet
Religious disease. I hold the
answers that you seek. Trade your
life for an addiction. I'll drain your
mind and fuck your soul
Spawned by the lord of darkness
And raised by the whore of the
angels. I've been sent to rape you
all. I am all sins, God Puppet. God
Puppet. Sheep who lost their shepherd.
Your God betrayed you all.
(Go!)
God Puppet. You fucking God Puppets.
I am all sins
Worn out - A broken, fucked-up
mind. An empty shell of life con-
scious, breathing, feeling. Forced
on society's back - nailed to the
freakshow cross.
Submissive lever raging through
the veins. Distorting the values
set by us all. You've lost all con-
trol. Immoral machines all pleas-
ure & greed.
Shadow World
Liquify the senses and inhale the
poison. A way to find the path to
divinity. Arise from filth, always
fought for what you believed in
The crystal saviour will help you
on your way
Distorting the values set by us
all. You've lost all control
Immoral machines of pleasure &
greed.
Shadow World
Slipping away into a twisted state
of grace. The pain ignites my
growth. Nightmare closing in,
bleeding and begging for an end
to come. The spawn of a shadow
world. Shadow world. Distorting
the values set by us all. You've
lost all control. Immoral
machines of pleasure & greed.
Shadow world. Shadow world.
As I'm crawling through the rem-
nants of life, you poison my soul
And leave me bleeding on the
ground.
I try to get back on my feet
But I'm still nailed to the edge
I'm still nailed...
A sickness breeds inside my
mind. The seed of my own cre-
ation. I'm standing at the edge
With no fear of falling. The pres-
ent is my future. And the future is
my past. So divine, the other side
I'm not afraid. My filth pollutes
your life, I feel ashamed.
As I'm running through the
remains. Just dying for that final
plunge. Now standing at the edge
With no fear at all. Every new
beginning comes from somebody
else's end. A leap away from the
other side, I'm not afraid. With
broken wings I try to fly. I feel
ashamed.
Fuck it, I'll push you !!
So divine, the other side, I'm not
afraid. With broken wings I try to fly
I feel ashamed. Forever falling. I'm
everlasting
Voices break the silence. Shadows
infect the white-clad walls. Death is
breathing down your neck.
Yoy try ty flee. Forced into submis-
sion. You try to repent. A strip of
tape that kills the screams. You
know this is the end. Surgical steel
twist the flesh. The hand of doom
carves out the mesh.
D.O.A.
- What more when you're dead on arrival?
- What more when you're dead on arrival?
Doped up soul-Senses numb.
Fluids burst into flames. Every high
is a new low. In these vermin-infest-
ed streets. Chained to the altar of
debt. The breed of your sins. Nailed
to the cross of guilt. The spawn of
your greed. A strip of tape that kills
the screams. A deep inspired - The
circle is complete.
D.O.A.
- What more when you're dead on
arrival?
- What more when you're dead on
arrival?
- What more when you're dead on
arrival?
[Instrumental]
Sature the souls of a virgin land.
A nation on its knees by its own naive
beliefs. Feasting on the flesh of our starving
whore. Idly looking on as it bites once
more. Fallen sanctuary stripped off. God,
now worship dogs. Where porno mags
replaces the bible. Who can save us now?
Self-inflicted madness. Run in circles,
come on catch your tail. He's gone hunting,
hunting for humans. Our urban carnivore.
Stone! The one who speaks of justice.
Rape! The one who cries for freedom. Exit
the dreams of full remorse. Enter the urban
predator. Exit the dreams of full remorse.
Enter the urban predator. Still we want our
shit to add up.
Just don't like what it adds up to.
Society's fading foes were first in line &
last to know.
Concede the surplus killing. Clear the
table now roll the dice. Pass the matches,
join the feast. Utopia in flames. Time is the
fire in which we burn. Home, depraved and
tainted from the life we lead. Exit the
dreams of full remorse. Enter the urban
predator. Exit the dreams of full remorse.
Ravished by the urban predator. Concede
the surplus killing. Clean the table now roll
the dice.
Pass the matches, join the feast. Utopia
alight.
Exit the dreams of full remorse
Enter the urban predator
Exit the dreams of full remorse
Ravished by the urban predator
Exit the dreams of full remorse
Enter the urban predator
Enter the urban predator
Ravished
Falling. Leaving my plague behind.
Cannot live this futile lie.
Resurrected. Immune to your poison.
The world that I see [has] lost its
creed [where] sin speaks through the
wicked hell repossessed by those
who burn with the guilt of being
born.
Trapped ! Trapped in this down-
ward spiral. A vicious circle of lies
Fuelled with revenge. Now I'm
repossessing what's mine
Another beating, can't move at all
With sweet forgiviness you'll take
the toll. Rise! Fight back! It's all
within the mind. Trapped ! Trapped
in this downward spiral. A vicious
circle of lies. Laugh at your foe. Now
I'm repossessing what's mine.
Thrust the blade. Into this corroded
world. Laugh at your foe. While you
set his spirit free.
Pain! Guilt! Hatred!
Revelations of a dying world. Raise
your fists in anger. Fight back !
Elevate in the hierarchy. Reserve the
line of command.
I've been burnt by the fire within
Fallen. Left my plague behind. Won't
succumb to the futile lies.
Resurrected. I will not give in.
Trapped ! Trapped in this downward
spiral. A vicious circle of lies. Hell
repossessed. I've been burnt by the
fires within. Escaping this downward
spiral. Free to breath again. Only to
return once more.
Soulless and resurrected. Hiding
where hate resides. I've died in as
many ways. As you can say die.
Infertile Tries. Still I compromise
to meet your master's will. Tarnished
veins, eternal pain. Now innocence
is fading, is fading...
Into my infernal dreams of passion.
That I appease with deeds of sin. You
got your wings from the angels
divine. I stole mine from flies that died.
Needle lies. Holds our demise.
Seems every day has lost its thrill. I
damn the voices inside my head.
Now sanity is fading.
Death lurks where life is cheap
I won't betray what rules my mind -
Shithead! I'm convinced my life
returns in time - Shithead!
My roots beneath your skin
In your guilt I nest. Face the truth
that lies ahead. Alive or dead.
Infertile cries. Still I compromise to
meet your master's will. A feedle life
is a life undone. All that's life is
finally dying. Death lurks where life
expire. I can't betray what rules my
mind - Shithead! Still convinced my
life returns in time - Shithead! Life's
but a dress rehearsal for hell. I'm
convinced my life returns in time -
Shithead!
Infertile cries. Still I compromise
to meet your master's will. Tarnished
veins, eternal pain. Now innocence
is fading, is fading.
Death lurks where life is cheap
I must betray what rules my mind -
Shithead!
Now I know my life will return in
time - Shithead!
The streets of broken dreams await
the darkness. To bring new souls
along for the ride. Another statistic
on the sidewalk. Found his peace at
last. In your stare, lost innocence.
Seen all the misery of this world.
Lonely ghosts escaping a dismal
past
Another statistic on the sidewalk
Found this peace at last.
It's my final bloodletting
In your stare, lost innocence. Seen
all the misery of this world. The
hangman's laughter echoes in the
alleys of the dead.
Put an end to the manic frustration.
Find my peace at last. Put an end to
this manic frustration.Find my peace
at last.
Shed the blood that runs through my
veins. Bloodletting. When you bleed
seek salvation in me. When you bleed
seek salvation in me.
I stab you in the face just to let the
world know how I feel. Can you
sense my pain? I am not scared to die,
just biding time. No escape from the
raging fires. I'll set this world alight
just for you.
Desire
Face death sublime. My soul so dark
and hollow. Moulded by destructive
hands. Can you take the pain? Bury
you with your saviour. Foetal pose in
a pool of blood. I'll set my world
alight just for you.
Desire
Face death sublime. Fuel the fire.
One kill wonder. One kill.
I feel the hatred rise within me.
Fulfil my need and watch you die.
Can you feel my pain? I guess you
can - Right up to the fuckin' hilt. Left
behind for the world to know. My
Terror - Now the tide has turned
I said the tide has turned. Desire
Face death sublime. One kill wonder.
One kill
I never cared what you said
It never mattered to me anyway
I'll rip your head off and watch you bleed
Tell it to my face. You lose. I win!
Oh!
Don't speak. Don't talk to me
Why can't you see what you cannot be?
Problems to ???
What are you supposed to be?
It's not me. I am what I am
Can you really be so sure with me?
Telling me what's going on
Sick and tired of people telling me
Who am I and what to be
Don't judge me
I've had enough
Don't judge me
Oh!
You think you're sacred
Really, you don't mean shit
The world doesn't stop
'cause you think it will
Don't care
If you think I'm not a fuckin' star
I've gotta laugh at you
That's who you aren't
He's just another wannabe
If you can say shit and can't get too far
'Cause I think you owe me a decision
So you sell out your own side?
Now you can puke up your creation ???
Don't Judge Me
I've had enough
Don't Judge Me
I've had enough
Don't Judge Me
I lost my dignity, I lost who I am.
My biggest problem is; I've become civilized.
Take my ???, known by no one.
My clock is ticking.
Don't even tempt me
I'll rip a hole in your life.
Leave me alone.
When you think I'm on the top
I reverse and tell you all to fuck off.
I will not be destroyed.
I refuse to be destroyed.
Oh.
So you thought you knew me?
Where I stand?
I'm sorry to tell you, you fuck
And sorry you won't buy it
Get a life and leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
Yet there you are.
When you think I'm on the top
I reverse and tell you all to fuck off.
I will not be destroyed.
I refuse to be destroyed.
Don't even try to tempt me
I'll rip a hole in your life.
I don't understand why you even
Spend the time on my life.
Fuck you and everything you stand for
You and all your fucking magazines.
Don't even try to touch me
I'll rip a hole in your life.
When you think I'm on the top
I reverse and tell you all to fuck off.
I will not be destroyed.
I refuse to be destroyed.
I realized I never should be born
In this world where money talks
The honesty of systems can be won
When the power of dollar is running the life
We're closing our eyes
How could we be so blind
That we can't see what's going on?
The world's on edge of madness
It's burning out with frustration
We're never satisfied. It's never enough
We can't get enough
Trying hard to make an extra buck
To roll ourselves in luxury
We get our bottoms' overload
So we grab whatever we can take
Blinded by the dollar sign
A disease that burns through our minds.
The world's on edge of madness
It's burning out with frustration
We're never satisfied. It's never enough
We can't get enough
We are the world on edge of madness
It's burning out with frustration
We're never satisfied. It's never enough
We can't get enough
Its never enough
I realized I never should be born
In this world where money talks
The honesty of systems can be won
The world's on edge of madness
It's burning out with frustration
We're never satisfied. It's never enough
We can't get enough
We are the world on edge of madness
It's burning out with frustration
We're never satisfied. It's never enough
We can't get enough
Its never enough
Yeah.
I taste it. I need it.
How many ??? and I won't be part of it
I'd rather sold myself; be part of the dream
Pissing away life. I'm just getting older
My life is over
??? I'm gonna do
A public puppet. Just pull my string.
You say, "Jump!" I say, "How high?"
I live it. I breathe it.
It's my god and I get hungry without.
I taste it. I see it.
A public puppet is what I am.
One of you fuckheads could play my shit
I don't know when my body's calling it quits
I live it. I breathe it.
It's my god and I get hungry without.
I taste it. I see it.
A public puppet is what I am.
Trying to be afloat. Try to think of a ???
I have to do something just to stay alive
Tired of feeling alone trying to reach a goal
Destruction. I don't want no more
I live it. I breathe it.
It's my god and I get hungry without.
I taste it. I see it.
A public puppet is what I am.
Slip inside into the chaos/confusion
I don't know when to stop
Get myself wasted
Run around like a madman
This stuff will take another time.
I can't control myself
I don't know why
The devil's in my hand
He's pouring me another round
Feelings coming
I know I'm over my head
Turning slowly into a deadly game
Show my ass in all the public places
I'm too drunk to care
Puking contest. Touring nightmare
I'll do anything for a laugh
I can't control myself
I don't know why
The devil's in my hand
He's pouring me another round
Feelings coming
I know I'm over my head
Turning slowly into a deadly game
Reality floats away
I'm falling too fast
I need another drink
So I can despair
No!
Hey! Why don't you ever stop?
You're shittin' on yourself and shittin' in the wind
Rage, you're spitting out the bones
And I'd like to think you don't understand.
Die! Why don't you fuckin' die or run and hide?
Ha! Ain't got the fuckin' time to hear you fuckin' lie.
You're driving me crazy
Knock it off, I'll fuck you up
I've made enough to hold the top
You give me no choice
Die! Why don't you fuckin' die and run and hide?
Shit. Just talk your fuckin' shit
Spinning lies
I hear it's calling
Judgement Day
I feel it's calling your name
I see it's coming
Rolling in
'Cause we may never turn the page
You're face. Just hate your stupid face
Don't wanna be around you when you are near
Dig yourself six feet under
You'll never ever come back again
I hear it's calling
Judgement Day
I feel it's calling your name
I see it's coming
Rolling in
'Cause we may never turn the page
Do you think I care what's on your mind?
I don't wanna see your ugly face
I got no time. I run and hide.
Turn you upside down
Don't wanna waste our time
Send you straight to death
I'm gonna put you down in hell
I hear it's calling
Judgement Day
I feel it's calling your name
I see it's coming
Rolling in
'Cause we may never turn the page
You haven't thought since the day you ???
It's like a hemorrhoid that fucks with my life
You look at me like you've never seen me before
Do you think I care?
You're just another trick
Snap out of it
What are you remarking?
I don't want to hear you no more
I'll no longer talk to your ass
Decision comes on every whim
If they're screaming, I won't hear it
I know your kind. Snap out of it
Filled with anger. Filled with hate.
I know your kind, you're just a waste of time
You try to twist it.
I spit in your face
I don't see a reason to argue
Why do you compliment?
You're just wasting your breath
Oh. Here we go
Snap out of it
What do ???
I don't want to hear you no more
I'll no longer talk to your ass
Decision comes on every whim
If they're screaming, I won't hear it
I know your kind. Snap out of it
Filled with anger. Filled with hate.
I know your kind, you're just a waste of time
Can't you see the devil
They curse away your life
What were your impressions?
They will blow your mind
It's time to cleave up your worst enemy
And see how bad they bleed
Trapped in your own cage
Sliced from humanity
How does it feel
To be locked up in your own free world?
Trapped in the shell
Another dead end for another dead man
Four walls are closing in
You're screaming but you can't be heard
You better believe it
Another dead end for another dead man
Oh. Strike back with your anger
You'll face against the wall
Just another day
Been watching over you
What you wanted to see
You stole the years
But you can't feel the difference
Your futures assigned
You're now part of the system
How does it feel
To be locked up in your own free world?
Trapped in the shell
Another dead end for another dead man
Four walls are closing in
You're screaming but you can't be heard
You better believe it
Another dead end for another dead man
Use your anger
Reap revenge
Use your anger
Don't turn away
Seeds of the Chosen One
Inject the Holy whore
To make the ultimate child
Laboratory rat that fucked with Mother Nature
It's like a Russian roulette
This time I know we went too far - Playing God
It will hit back on us all
Is this how it'll end you can count me out
It will never last -- A lethal game
We're on our way to see the ending
We're on our way to get erased
Time is tickin' -- Mother Earth's twisted
And we'll all loose control
Scientific murder
I knew I'd begone
You and I are not included
Step aside -- Move away
I'll move alone
Now I know we went too far -- Playing God
Time is Up for the human race
We've passed the point of no return
We're already out of the game
You and I
We will never last -- A lethal game
We're on our way to see the ending
We're on our way to get erased
Time is tickin' -- Mother Earth's twisted
And we'll all loose control
I've been searching for the peace in my mind
It's nowhere to be found.
Your soul with me
Resting under my skin.
I see no point of living the life I lead
It hurts me too much.
Can you feel what I feel?
It must go deep.
My own soul is my enemy.
[Chorus]
It seems like everything I do just crashes down
It leaves an open scar that I know will never heal.
Broken promises now run through my head
I can't see the future and it all turns black.
What's the point of being here
When this whole life is dragging me down?
Is this how we'll be?
I don't want to be part of it.
It must go deep.
My own soul is my enemy.
[Chorus]
It seems like everything I do just crashes down
It leaves an open scar that I know will never heal.
Broken promises now run through my head
I can't see the future. It all turns black.
If there's another way
You can live another day
Then you'll know just when pressure's getting stronger.
I can hear voices calling my name
I guess they are over my head.
It seems like everything I do just crashes down
It leaves an open scar that I know will never heal.
Broken promises now run through my head
The way of life
Read between the lies
Blind man preach to the deaf
The sacrifice in a holy battle
No one will forget
Limping through the ashes of the remains
No soul was saved
The great genocide
Our fates are sustained
In the valley of the damned
The battle's on
The troops of death
The falling army marches on
Hiding from the sun
Lurk them into darkness
Forbidden to be seen
Spirit of the evil gods
Triumph army of the ghost
Their victory inside
The enemy mutilated
Now lays before their feet
In the valley of the damned
The battle's on
The troops of death
The falling army marches on
Strike down the opponents
With wrath from below
The fallen angels' army
Will march to the throne
March
In the valley of the damned
The battle's on
The troops of death
The falling army marches on
Awaiting your sentence
Locked up in your hell
Your crime will now be tested
By the jury representing Death
Bitterness inside you
All you feel is hate
Not for the vicious crime
But for the victims you kept alive
Incision, precision, remove the limps
The pulse beats on, the body won't turn cold
I stab, I drill, my intention's clear
My hands they squeeze, but the bastard won't die
Hang him high
No remorse for the crimes you've done
Hang him high
Blood on your hands won't wash away
Waiting on deathrow
Staring at the walls
The cell is closing up on me
Memories I can't defeat
I stab, I drill, my intention's clear
My hands they squeeze, but the bastard won't die
Hang him high
No remorse for the crimes you've done
Hang him high
Blood on your hands won't wash away
A scarred and abused soul
Tries to cope with life
Hiding in your twisted game
He was dead before he started to feel alive
Now justice will take its toll
Hang him high
No remorse for the crimes you've done
Hang him high
Blood on your hands won't wash away
Symbols and signs painted everywhere
Predynamic hieroglyphs
A path, a stargate
Armageddon awaits on the other side
Storms of hate will plow over the earth
Science working to crack the code
Bury the gateway, let it go
Don't let them through
Can not gamble with the human race
Solar - empire
Resurrection of the atomic god
Solace - deceiver
Searching for another host
Through the black holes
Travelled for lightyears
Looking for another world to reign
Rebel attack with intelligent masses
Exterminate the enemy with full energy
Science working to crack the code
Bury the gateway, let it go
Don't let them through
Can not gamble with the human race
Solar - empire
Resurrection of the atomic god
Solace - deceiver
Searching for another host
If we can not confirm this
Then it doesn't exist
So bury it down again for a thousand years
Solar - empire
Resurrection of the atomic god
Solace - deceiver
Searching for another host
The cryogenic holocaust
Slows down the disease
Give us all a taste of your miracle
We're thirsty for your medicine
The hate burns in our eyes
It's kill or be killed
It's in the nature of the human races' weak mind
To be exterminated by ourselves
Just stab their hearts for nothing
Your greedy souls scream in envy
Kill them all
Release the anger
Weed out the weak
You don't need them
Weed out the weak
Exterminate the riff raff
No one will miss you anyway
Clean up the world with an iron fist
Start the harvest of the dead
There's no room for the weakend mind
There's no room for you
There is a new religion coming around the bend
And it's called fuck you
Just stab their hearts for nothing
Your greedy souls scream in envy
Kill them all
Release the anger
Weed out the weak
You don't need them
Weed out the weak
Stab them all
Bright lights
Is there anybody out there?
From the sky something's coming my way
It knocked me down, I'm paralyzed except my mind
Something else is in control of me
Strapped down to a bench I lie
Performing surgery, I'm open wide
My life just got simplified
I can't believe I'm gonna die
Dwelling in the unknown
I won't see tomorrow
They're stealing my life
They're drilling into my soul
I can't see tomorrow
I am out of time
Dwelling in the unknown
I won't see tomorrow
They're stealing my life
They're drilling into my soul
I can't see tomorrow
I am out of time
They keep me alive so they can test my strength
Pumping my body dry
I cannot feel anything anymore
I guess this is my goodbye
Strapped down to a bench I lie
Performing surgery, I'm open wide
My life just got simplified
I can't believe I'm gonna die
Dwelling in the unknown
I won't see tomorrow
They're stealing my life
They're drilling into my soul
I can't see tomorrow
I am out of time
There is no tomorrow
They're stealing my life
The colonisation of a new species
Infecting you and me
The virus has mutated
Into an extra-terrestrial biological entity
The blessed ones will be genetic hybrids
The survival is the ultimate ideology
We got to fight the future
The geometry of mass infection - global domination
Presented to an extended holocaust
It has started
The global domination
Mass infection
Waiting to be reconstituted
And colonized by an alien race
And unvolved pathogen
The mass infection will make us a slave race
The blessed ones will be genetic hybrids
The survival is the ultimate ideology
We got to fight the future
The geometry of mass infection - global domination
Presented to an extended holocaust
It has started
The mass infection
Treasure hunts in suicide land
The hurting never stops
It's time to meet your enemy
Bleeding games with buried anger
It will be too late
When you're done you'll plead insanity
Drown them in the dirt
Energize the will to kill
Never say a word
Strike them where it hurts
Torture with all you got
A taste of extreme divinity
Stealthy shadows of the mad
Lionize his victory
Legacy of a sick twisted man has been born
Razor sharp brain with desire
Desire for the kick
The kick to kill
Drown them in the dirt
Energize the will to kill
Never say a word
Strike them where it hurts
Torture with all you got
A taste of extreme divinity
Psycho dances with a knife
He comes for your flesh
Knock you down, tie you up
Feel the blade break your skin
You call yourself a god
I call you a liar
I'll take your crucifix and stab it straight through your heart
Reclaim my past, don't need no sympathy
I only wanna be me and not live in your religious fantasy world
Brainwash the weak
Steal all you can steal
Defenseless minds of the dumber kind
The church is working overtime
The book of lies becomes alive again
Translated, twisted, read between the lines
The ancient book is still alive
And now they can not tell the truth from lies
They convince you that you're nothing
And nothing but dirt
If you don't contribute
You're no son of god
Donate your life and money that you earn
If you wanna see the light you got to sacrifice
Brainwash the weak
Steal all you can steal
Defenseless minds of the dumber kind
God is working overtime
The book of lies becomes alive again
Translated, twisted, read between the lines
The ancient book is still alive
And now they can not tell the truth from lies
Don't wanna live in sin
They will make you learn
If you're gonna sin
Then you're gonna burn
The book of lies becomes alive again
Translated, twisted, read between the lines
The ancient book is still alive
And now they can not tell the truth from lies
One's loss is another's pain
When someone falls then the others gain
Misjudged and stripped down to the bones
The industry is getting rich on the poor
They'll make you bleed out your anger
No one will ask you for your forgiveness
The quest for the sign
Will stop at nothing
Follows the book of lies
Your god told you to look for the sign
Suck 'em all dry like a parasite
Kill a million people
And kill another million more
They don't believe in what you believe
It's not your gods' call
Misjudged and stripped down to the bones
The industry is getting rich on the poor
They'll make you bleed out your anger
No one will ask you for your forgiveness
The quest for the sign
Will stop at nothing
Follows the book of lies
Your god told you to look for the sign
Suck 'em all dry like a parasite
Everything is build on conspiracy
Nothing has been changed
We just smile, accept everything
Why do we turn our backs and walk away
It's hard to tell right from wrong
It's all a conspiracy
Like blindfolded cattles
And lead us on til the end
We all are living in a twisted society
Nothing's gonna stop them
When the truth won't set us free
Tamed
Filled with fear
Sky is falling down
Sophistic energy
A crack in the core
A burning sodomy for liberty
Feel the neon dots that's tattooed in your flesh
Cause they don't want you to think in any different way
Psychotic preferences
A state of reinvent
And now the new world has just begun
Scream all you want
While they drill the holes
Lobotomy will set you free
Cyanide sacrifice
Laser beam sanctuary
Transit life, suicide
Bad dreams do come true
Sky's falling down
Pull the plug
Terminate, innocent, tranquilized
Cannot wake up
Back in the womb
Waiting for the rebirth
Tube stuck in your veins
Monitored by machines
Back in the womb
Waiting for the rebirth
Tube stuck in your veins
Monitored by machines
Electric pulses feeding your brain
Sky's falling down
Pull the plug
Terminate, innocent, tranquilized
Cannot wake up
Sky's falling down
Take me home
[Digipak bonus song]
Raped by the retribution
A failing justice at it's costs
Demanding true redemption
And regain what you've lost
In the shadows of the weakend kind
Lurking for its prey
Shapeless, worthless, gutless souls
From behind the desk they'll make you the
Sinner - They'll send you out to the front to be the
Sinner - Where the bullets reign
Sinner - Just aim and squeeze the trigger, you are the
Sinner - You are the scape goat betrayed by your nation
In the name of democracy
Rules the country with an iron fist
But the stench from the gutter
Says that they are leaders of hypocrisy
Shapeless, worthless, gutless souls
From behind the desk they'll make you the
Sinner - They'll send you out to the front to be the
Sinner - Where the bullets reign
Sinner - Just aim and squeeze the trigger, you are the
Sinner - You are the scape goat betrayed by your nation
It's brothers in arms
Shattered by your feet
Sacrificed for democracy
Left behind at the enemy line
By the land of the free
We fight...
We die...
If there was a single day I could live... a single breath I could take
I'd trade all the others away.
The blood's on the wall, so you'd might as well just admit it
And bleach out the stains, commit to forgetting it.
You're better off empty and blank, than left with a single pathetic trace of this
Smother another failure, lay this to rest.
Console yourself, you're better alone
Destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck
Absorb yourself, you're better alone
Destroy yourself.
I'll chain you to the truth, for the truth shall set you free
I'll turn the screws of vengeance and bury you with honesty
I'll make all your dreams come to life, then slay them as quickly as they came
Smother another failure, lay this to rest.
Console yourself, you're better alone
Destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck
Absorb yourself, you're better alone
Destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck.
Failure.
If there was a day I could live, if there was a single breath I could take
I'd trade all the others away.
Privileged, a chosen few
Blessed with our time in hell
Witness a divine vision, the day we all fell still.
Rapture of the dying age, a shattered hourglass
Wrath of the warring gods and so this too shall pass.
It's only getting worse, not worth a moment's regret
Each dawn another curse, every breath a twisting blade
What will be left behind in the ashes of the wake?
An ill wind blows this way, the edge of the envelope burns
Forbearance and my vengeance, payment for you intent
Fear and death in the wings, in thrall of those fallen from grace
Petty is as petty does, witness the mass disgrace.
God forbid you read the signs, watch for meanings between the lines
Gehenna has now arrived, no hindsight for the blind.
Your trust has been misplaced, believed the lies told to your face
Became another casualty and now it's too late.
You finally made it home, draped in the flag that you fell for.
And so it goes
The a shes of the wake.
It's only getting worse...
Now you've got something to die for.
Infidel, Imperial
Lust for blood, a blind crusade
Apocalyptic, we count the days.
Bombs to set the people free, blood to feed the dollar tree
Flags for coffins on the screen, oil for the machine
Army of the liberation, gunpoint indoctrination
The fires of sedition
Fulfill the prophecy.
Now you've got something to die for.
Send the children to the fire, sons and daughters stack the pyre
Stoke the flame of the empire, live to lie another day
Face of hypocrisy, raping democracy
Apocalyptic, we count the days.
We'll never get out of this hole until we've dug our own grave
And drug the rest down with us, the burning home of the brave
Burn.
Now you've got something to die for.
Witness shame's parade, the pain of blame repaid
It's fucking hopeless
Accusations and denial.
Hopeless... demon of another day
Colorless... stoned, solid grey
Emptiness... of promises I made
So faithless... the tenets long betrayed.
Walk the faded line, cursed crawl of time
Silence, the only promise ever kept.
Familiar touch, a ritual to numb the cut
Salvation in vice
Anguish is realizing what could have been, but never was
It's emptiness that fills the cup
Devotion in the method of my fall.
Pointless... futility continuing
Endless... flowing corrupted vein.
Walk the faded line, cursed crawl of time
Silence, the only promise ever kept.
Hopeless.
Whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward.
Whoever cannot take care of themselves without that law is both.
For a wounded man shall say to his assailant,
'If I live, I will kill you. If I die, You are forgiven.'
Such is the rule of honour.
Broken the paradigm an example must be set
Invoke the Siren's song and sign the death warrant.
The tongues of men and angels bought by a beloved betrayer.
I am the result what's better left unspoken
Violence begins to mend what was broken
You've been talking, I've been all ears.
Words meant to dwell in darkness shall never see the light of day
Words can be broken, so can bones
Execute the mandate
Mouth full of dirt.
Your name is removed from the registry
St. Peter greets with empty eyes then turns and locks the gate.
I am the result what's better left unspoken
Violence begins to mend what was broken
You've been talking, I've been all ears
Omerta.
Cheaply venal, stupidly verbose
A slip of the tongue, a slit of the throat
Six feet under with no marker
Keep my name from your mouth forever.
Free speech for the living, dead men tell no tales
Your laughing finger will never point again.
Omerta.
Sing for me now.
All of this comes crashing down.
Cornerstone's gone
Sleepless.
Hopeless.
No end in sight.
Ink well has run dry, fill it with blood of the scribe.
Rest comes easy to the guiltless
The vampire laments as he prays for the sun.
Doom, despair, tragedy are the tools of the trade.
Cut to the bone, rob the grave
Unearth the stone, lay to waste
Defile the tome, rip the page
Strip mine the vein, lay to waste.
Frayed at the edge, flat lined.
The anvil cracks.
The hammer relentlessly comes down.
A new pariah is born.
Chastisement lays you down to sleep, tucks you in with bloody kisses
Gifts of nightmares bitter sweet.
Type A negative shuts me down.
Catch phrase will be the death of me.
This is, not what you came to see?
What, are you not entertained?
Climb the walls 'til nails bleed.
Rip the hair, tear the seams, break the glass.
Head in hands, bell tolls endlessly
No end in sight.
The sins of deliverance
The eyes of the patriot fixed through the scope
The unknowing tyrant walks to the rope.
It's where murder is justice that martyrs are made
A one gun salute for the new independence day.
They'll hallow your name
They'll hallow your name for your sacrifice.
The sins of deliverance.
"So let the wicked perish in the presence of God."
(For your sacrifice)
The sins of the father atoned by the son
Confessions of commitments broken
A nail driven for every one (of them).
It's where murder is justice that martyrs are made
A one gun salute for the new independence day.
They'll hallow your name
They'll hallow your name for your sacrifice.
You are the cause, I am the effect
Created in hatred, a noose for your neck.
The eyes of the patriot fixed through the scope
The unknowing tyrant walks to the rope.
They'll hallow your name.
For your sacrifice.
They'll hallow your name.
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
They'll hallow your name
Endless mornings cut by the dawn razor
Whipping the nightmares to a froth
Endless questions with no answers
No replacement for what's been lost.
Lost.
Everything suffocates in the dust of the past fortunes squandered
The empire of lies to whom you pandered
Suffer a self-imposed exile, taste the bitter fruits of denial
In the presence of greatness the humble can only bow.
Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of nothing but deprivation
Eternal winter.
Tell me a lie with the best of intentions
Mute in the age of mass communication
Dark days lead to darker nights
Frozen, out of time.
It dies for blessed ego, the once mighty laid low.
Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of nothing but deprivation
You taught hate, I'll teach you fear
Open the eyes, kill despair
You cannot squeeze the life from me
Son of a bitch, I'm going to rape you.
Son of a bitch, I'm going to break you.
Blank stares from broken men
So withered from the poisons they can't remember when
There were once honest reasons.
Pretending I'm still here.
Justify what I've become, sanctify what I've become.
Amazing disgrace... (how) sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
Better lost if this is found, best blinded never to see.
The race to save face, nothing now is what we meant it to be.
Pretending I'm still here.
It's a system now, intertwined.
Take your place in the line to be ground by the gears of the masterpiece.
Betrayal.
Suffered consequence
It's been so long since any piece of this made any kind of sense.
You anoint the king, I'll burn everything down to ashes.
You giveth, I taketh away.
It's a system now, intertwined.
Take your place in the line to be ground by the gears of the masterpiece.
Betrayal.
"We killed a lot of innocent civilians.
To us every civilian in Baghdad was a terrorist.
These Fedayeen are now in civilian clothes that makes everybody free game,
But if they came in our perimeter, we lit 'em up.
And when we would pull the body out, and when we would search the car, we would find nothing.
This took place time and time again. No harm, no foul, that's OK, don't worry about it,
Because this is a new type of war, this is an eradication."
"I honestly feel we're committing genocide over here,
I don't believe in killing civilians, and I'm not going to kill civilians for the United States Marine Corp."
[Quoted as a Marine in Song]
The dirty lord of the manor surveys his filthy domain
Too many nights raising hell worked a little all too well.
Constructed a monument to denial and excess
Sunk so low, crawled so far back there's nowhere left to regress.
If these walls could talk, they would tell a horror story
Never-ending winter, violence and infidelity
Shadows fall through broken panes
Careless words that are filled with hate
Just enough to keep it together, never enough to make it work.
All the tongues here are forked.
We are a hailstorm of broken glass, follow the path of least expectancy.
A huge stinking pile of sick, pile it higher and higher.
Light the match, start the fire.
Level this place until nothing is left and take us with it.
Surroundings are irate.
Crack of dawn brings naught but pain.
Resentment steadily grows.
Laughing in the gallows.
Full throttle determined to fail, pedal to the metal asleep at the wheel.
We are the lucky ones, welcome home.
Poisoned nerves and a bloody antidote
Violence is not an aberration, it's a rule.
Dying beyond the pale.
Your beatings will continue until my morale improves.
I don't hate you, I'm just removing an enemy.
Remorse is for the dead, my enemy.
Remorse is for the dead.
[Japanese Bonus Track]
At a loss for something different to say,
I've said everything, we've said it all before.
An extra nail for your coffin.
I'm going to ride that horse we've beaten to death,
And deliver its stinking carcass to your doorstep.
A gift from all the dead children,
That are the progeny of your ballistic union.
Borrowing from Peter to rape Paul,
No news is good news, but I've got some news for you.
Fetch me a rope, lynch mob of one.
An extra nail for your coffin.
Certain blood has been shed for uncertain reasons.
You will never quiet this storm,
A cold wind to chill your bones.
I bring the hammer down.
Borrowing from Peter to rape Paul,
No news is good news, but I've got some news for you.
Fetch me a rope, lynch mob of one.
Pray for blood,
Pray for the cleansing,
Pray for the flood,
Pray for the end of this nightmare.
This lie of a life can as quickly as it came dissolve.
We seek only reprieve and welcome the darkness.
The myth of a meaning so lost and forgotten (forgotten).
Take hold of my hand,
For you are no longer alone.
Walk with me in hell.
Pray for solace,
Pray for resolve,
Pray for a savior,
Pray for deliverance, some kind of purpose.
A glimpse of a light in this void of existence.
Now witness the end of an age.
Hope dies in hands of believers.
Who seek the truth in the liar's eye.
Take hold of my hand,
For you are no longer alone.
Walk with me in hell.
Take hold of my hand,
For you are no longer alone.
Walk with me in hell.
Store-bought attitude and spit,
A sugar-coated piece of shit.
An instant rebel, just add greed.
Another useless commodity.
Broken glass and a broken jaw.
Lies are told in a southern drawl.
Poor-house poverty's your schtick.
The real thing would kill you quick.
Rise, again we will rise.
Rise, again we will rise.
Blood and fire used to fill the night,
Burnt and drowned by our very lives.
You missed a sinking boat by years,
Dollar signs, crocodile tears.
It's over now and long has been,
Those days are gone won't come again.
Another name crossed off the list.
The real thing would kill you quick.
Rise, again we will rise.
Rise, again we will rise.
There's nothing for you to fight against,
You're so unreal it's evident.
You'll never be one of our kind,
This ain't yours, fuck you, don't try.
This bridge was burnt before you could cross,
You reap the benefits of what's lost.
Go home son, hang your costume up,
A goddamn insult to the rest of us.
A thousand-yard stare across the south,
A fully belly and a lying mouth.
Mamma's boy plays heretic.
The real thing would kill you quick.
Rise, again we will rise.
Rise, again we will rise.
Fuck you, don't even try.
Fuck you, your time is nigh.
Fuck you, I've had enough.
Fuck you, your time is up.
So goddamn easy to write this,
You make it spill on the page.
So drunk on yourself, self-righteous,
A laughing stock of your own fucking stage.
But I ain't one to call names,
Or throw stones in a house of glass.
You try me.
This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need.
This is a motherfucking invitation.
You try me.
Just one time you got a reason,
Heard you had nothing to lose.
A blind preacher for the pin-eyed congregation,
It must be easy to lose.
But I ain't one to call names,
Or throw stones in a house of glass.
You try me.
This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need.
This is a motherfucking invitation.
You try me.
You can tell the same lie a thousand times,
But it never gets any more true,
So close your eyes once more and once more believe
That they all still believe in you.
Just one time.
This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
Just one time
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me
Just one time
You try me
Just one time
You try me
You try me
Somewhere between an excuse and a lie,
You found something that you believe.
So proud, I guess I can't imagine why,
Three cheers for what we used to be.
Pathetic. Wasted. Soulless. Compromised.
Sleep-walking the mind field.
Shit talking, it crumbles around you.
It comes back around.
Somewhere between delusion and denial,
You'll drown in your own sympathy.
Profound, at least you thought so at the time,
A ghost of who you used to be.
Sleep-walking the mind field.
Shit talking, it crumbles around you.
It comes back around.
Pathetic. Wasted. Soulless. Compromised.
Virginia death threat, Virginia creeper vine.
The hands that feed intent, choke the purpose of this time.
Take all that you can give, and I will make it mine.
No care for what you've spent, even fool's gold has its shine.
Never held down, never restrained.
Virtue's foot to the throat, free of broken chains.
Thus always to tyrants,
Laugh at the conquered, the victims now betray.
And in this Commonwealth,
There's merely a common concern for self.
We hold these lies to be self-evident
As the dividends will reflect.
And in this Commonwealth,
There's merely a common concern for self.
The coffers have long run dry.
Never held down, never restrained.
Virtue's foot to the throat, free of broken chains.
Thus always to tyrants,
Laugh at the conquered, the victims now betray.
The victims now betray.
Like a bull in a china shop,
But the shelves have all been cleared.
A thief in an empty vault,
The sheep already sheared.
A screen door on a submarine,
An eagle with a broken wing,
Hope in a dead man's dream,
The sound of a bell that will never ring.
The river I'm bound to be found in,
A rope chosen bound for the hang.
When I'm blind and I think I see everything,
Convincing myself again.
This God that I worship (a faded reflection).
This demon I blame (a flickering flame).
Conspire as one, exactly the same.
It's exactly the same.
Descending,
To never recover the pieces to all that we've lost.
Recover the pieces lost.
The pieces to all we've lost.
I shudder to think of the consequence,
It's blasphemy simple and true.
The tragic protagonist torments,
Convincing myself again.
This God that I worship (a faded reflection).
This demon I blame (a flickering flame).
Conspire as one, exactly the same.
It's exactly the same.
Descending,
To never recover the pieces to all that we've lost.
Descending,
To never recover the pieces to all that we've lost.
Recover the pieces lost.
The pieces to all we've lost.
This God that I worship
This demon I blame
Conspire as one, exactly the same
It's exactly the same
It's exactly the same
It's exactly the same
Seize the darkened day, there's only Hell to pay.
And no one left to see this prodigal return.
Sweet apathy's black toll, you'll mourn the traded soul.
I'll dig a deeper hole, sanctity a breath away.
Just a breath away.
Blacken the cursed sun,
You're not the only one.
To have sunk so far and low,
There is no tomorrow.
A tragedy on display, a sickness for all to see,
I will kill this part of myself that I hate
And that I see in you.
It was always mine anyways,
There's somethings you can't take away.
I choose not to feel a thing,
Sanctity a breath away.
Just a breath away.
Blacken the cursed sun,
You're not the only one.
To have sunk so far and low,
There is no tomorrow.
Blacken the cursed sun,
Blacken what's yet to be done.
Blacken because now you know,
There is no tomorrow.
Better to die quick, fighting on your feet,
Then to live forever, begging on your knees.
Begging on your, begging on your
Begging on your knees
Can we still be saved?
Hell, no!
Does your God hold a place for us?
Hell, no!
Is there time to repent?
Hell, no!
Will we rise from the dead?
Hell, no!
Can these sins even be forgiven?
Hell, no!
Is there still hope for us?
Hell, no!
Were we ever even alive?
Hell, no!
Is any of this even real?
Hell, no!
This is a mean and cold town,
I hate this fucking place.
Watch the rats as they all drown,
Dying slowly day by day.
Decrepit and falling down,
Cesspool of human waste.
Swallow profit in deep now
In death you'll finally know the taste.
There are no souls left here to save.
Forgotten, lost angels, long disgraced.
You fucking hypocrite,
But hooks in lips they do not lie.
Compassion served not on your plate,
How many of them have you watched die?
I can't sing you a happy song,
I can't write you a sing-a-long,
The only catchy hook I've got,
Is the one in my bleeding gut.
Burn it down
Burn it down
There are no souls left here to save.
Forgotten, lost angels, long disgraced.
Dead stares, dead eyes,
Choked hopes and vacant minds,
Blank words, blank lives,
The end result of endless lies.
There's no angels here,
To get lost in the first place
Jackhammer a fault line,
Pray for earthquakes.
Mulholland's on fire,
And my cig started it.
We're here to finish it.
I'm not impressed by much here,
Much less what you have to say.
Don't give a fuck who you know,
I just want to leave this hellhole
Know that you mean nothing to me,
Nor the lies that seep from your teeth.
Won't piss on you if you're on fire,
One more self-important liar.
Burn it down.
Burn it down.
There are no souls left here to save
Forgotten lost angels long disgraces
Burn it, burn it
Burn it, burn it
Burn it, burn it
Burn it down
Down, chemical sacrament,
Blasphemous prayer.
Deliver me from this so serene apocalypse
Just make me fucking numb,
Deaf, blind and fucking dumb.
Return to sacred sleep.
This could be my requiem,
And I'll feel no pain.
This could be my requiem,
But don't bury me too deep.
Drain infected brine,
Sickened cesspool shell of mine.
Strap up the hands of time,
And push the soul into the vein
Just make me fucking numb,
Deaf, blind and fucking dumb.
Return to sacred sleep.
This could be my requiem,
And I'll feel no pain.
This could be my requiem,
But don't bury me too deep.
Sink, suffer, self destruct.
Rise, stronger, reconstruct.
Dispose, discard, deny.
And I will feel no pain.
I just got the news today you were dying,
Hot Damn! We're already partying.
But please, before you have to leave,
Let me tell you a few last things.
Suffer unto me
Indulge my every need.
I don't want to meet you halfway
I've always despised that fucking place,
Suffer unto me
Indulge my every need.
I'm not offering you my way
I'm kicking you down the fucking highway.
Get one thing straight from the get-go,
I truly don't give a fuck about you
I never have and I never will,
Each day you breathe it's more time to kill.
Fuck Your World Up (Goddamn!)
Your last breath, I'll take it now
Your last breath, I'll take it now
Your last breath, I'll rip it away
And haunt your dreams in your final sleep
You've been wishing in one hand and shitting in the other
You see which one filled up first
Your number's come up
And it sure as hell ain't a lucky one son
Get one thing straight from the get-go,
I truly don't give a fuck about you
I never have and I never will,
Each day you breathe it's more time to kill
She's a slack one, born of greed.
Speaking endless words, long and empty.
A beggar who still wants to choose,
A dethroned queen still demands her dues.
If you want something for nothing you take what you get,
A virgin whore in a dirty wedding dress.
Scream for salvation, beating on death's door.
But just be careful what you wish for.
There's blood stain on the ceiling,
But you're the only duck in the shooting gallery.
Trying to look out through a bricked-in window,
Your destiny lies in the alley below.
Trying to see yourself in a shattered mirror,
When all else fails, she holds you with broken arms.
There's poison in her veins, but the bitch comes for free,
A quick fix for all that you think that you need.
Scream for salvation, beating on death's door.
But just be careful what you wish for.
The patron saint of fools answers all your request,
She's all yours now, so deal with it.
There's no shoulder left to cry wolf on,
You're tied in knots that can't be undone.
No more warnings will fall on deaf ears,
You lied too many times now no one cares.
No one cares.
An empty promise with a heart of tin,
Her crooked smile beguiles and it draws you within.
The hope for something more, all that you wish for,
A kick to the head and a boot to the door.
Chasing a dragon in a ladies clothes,
A paper trail ends in choking smoke.
But you know that you lit the match yourself,
Play the burning cards that you dealt
Scream for salvation, beating on death's door.
But just be careful what you wish for.
The patron saint of fools answers all your request,
She's all yours now, so deal with it.
A sacred cash cow with sickly tits
Dripping temptation for hypocrites
to death she's beaten
The prosperous endlessly stating the obvious
Caught in your words, sever the knot this time
Somebody show me their true face
Face me once as I leave all that I despise
Face me as I unleash this hate refined
Indict the blameless
Transparent designs
Pathetic and shameless
Crucified
A legend in his own mind, enthroned by lies
A cheap Machiavelli plots his demise
Caught in your words, sever the knot this time
Somebody show me their true face
Face me once as I leave all that I despise
Face me as I unleash this hate refined
Face me as I leave all this far behind
Face me as I unleash this hate refined
What once gave life
Now infested with plague
The lamb lies with maggots
Blinded, gagged, betrayed
What once gave life
Now infested with plague
The lamb lies with maggots
The corpse bloated with rage
You want to blame me for the way you hate yourself
You think you can find who you are in someone else
Criticize to better your relative positioning
You've got a long way to go
So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
You're so set to fail
Somewhere you've finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray
A nameless heir apparent, paranoid despair
You take great measure to appear like you don't care
Precision and persuasion must precede the proper lie
You've lost it before you began
So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
you're so set to fail
Somewhere you've finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray
Chopping lines in international sand
Feeding blood junkie habits of the elephant man
Quench his thirst with Black Water rising
Executive outcomes on a burning horizon
Yeah motherfucker, let's take a ride
We're rolling route Irish, someone has got to die
Trick or treat, it's IEDs
So roll the dice as we leave
with more bang for Sam's buck
Guaran-fucking-teed, someone will bleed
Privatize to conceal all the lies
No need for all the formalities
Jump the kangaroo courts
and plant the lynching trees
Yeah motherfucker, let's take a ride
Running red lights in a green zone,
someone has got to die
Hidden Aegis, nothing here to see
So load the dice for me please
and Let's snort the bottom line
Crude cashed into refined
Guaran-fucking-teed, Just sign the deed
Someone will bleed
Someone has got to die
Ours is not to reason why
Ours is but to do if the pay rate's right
Black liquid assets fuck the mujaheddin
Paint their picket fences red with the American dream
Lay the hammer hammer down, get the job done right
Jacked up and clocked in into a fire fight
Covert reactions and you never saw me
A glass parking lot in the American dream
they all die
Everything you've ever begged me to be
Could never have meant any less to me
Everything you've ever asked me to say
It's so far away from the truth
Fake messiah
Stitches sown in your eyes
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
Over and over and ever again
Defending your insignificance
Useless intent hidden behind your mask
A coward's voice... Anonymous
So far away from the truth
Fake messiah
Stitches sown in your eyes
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
Fake messiah
Open mouth, drawing flies
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
Generation failure
Suspended in irrelevance
Slit you wide open
Just to see what you're made of
So far away from the truth...
Fake messiah
Stitches sown in your eyes
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
Fake messiah
Open mouth, drawing flies
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
Broken, Bones and the will
Capacity to disappear in misery saves
Soaking, pain as a thrill, hate to instill
Compassion's a cage
Forgiving the father
Read the story on my skin
I'll be the martyr
Falling from his grace again
Sunken, sooner or later
We crawl our way back into our favorite hole
Drunken, swallow the savior
And follow him to hang from the highest pole
Forgiving the father
Read the story on my skin
Tell me more about the man I should have been
I'll be the martyr
Falling from his grace again
This is where the end begins
I can feel your fear and weakness
I see my own in the mirrors of your eyes
Carved into a corner hopeless
There's death ahead and doom behind
There's a bad storm blowing in
And most of us won't make it
The wreckage of your past
Means nothing now, forsake it
The memories cripple you
You're torn apart, your doubt must
Die
It only fell apart 'cause you let it
Bled of all you had to lose
Pick up the pieces with your broken
Hands
It only fell apart 'cause you let it
Bled of all you had to lose
Pick up the pieces with your broken
Hands
Well there's those that do
And those that just do talking
We're all going through hell
It's burn or keep on walking
The blackguards sing their shanty
Pure death riding the wind
Right now it's do or die
Now will you choose to live
The memories that ruin you
You're torn apart your doubt must
Die
It only fell apart 'cause you let it
Bled of all you had to lose
Pick up the pieces with your broken
Hands
It only fell apart 'cause you let it
Bled of all you had to lose
Pick up the pieces with your broken
Hands
You best delay self-pity
Locked in devastation's throes
The noose waits you swinging
A blade of malice cuts the rope
Hostility ensues, no attempt to repent
your struggles vindicate the illest of intent
Die
It only fell apart 'cause you let it
Bled of all you had to lose
Pick up the pieces with your broken
Hands
It only fell apart 'cause you let it
Bled of all you had to lose
Pick up the pieces with your broken
Hands
And you may tremble before hell's gates
You may watch as the heavens fall
And you may slight the hands of fate
You may heed the siren's call
And you may reach every golden shore
Witness repent in the heathen
And you may dance in the sands of the war
You may sleep in the cradle of Eden
Betrayed your prophets
Dead seeds buried deep
An army of none
We'll prey on the weak
And you may walk through the river run dry
You may strike down the giant with stone
And you may never again speak a lie
Confess every sin and atone
And you may drink from the infidel's blood
As their civilization collapses
You may rejoice in the cleanse of the flood
And stare into the face of apocalypse
Betrayed your prophets
Dead seeds buried deep
An army of none
We'll prey on the weak
You will not comprehend
Or find words that will describe
The will of God and man
Until you watch someone die
Betrayed your prophets
Dead seeds buried deep
An army of none
We'll prey on the weak
Then you wake...
Another body bag, pathetic,
Picture frame obituary faded in the attic
A shadow of someone you used to be
You've seen so many in these flames
And swore that you'd never become the cliche
A long forgotten memory
And when you wake...
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you never had
Everything learned forgotten and dead
Everything turns to nothing
another day, a little dirt for the grave
Is it worth everything that you gave
What a beautiful way to waste away
Consumed by dependency
A lesson in despondency
A long forgotten memory
And when you wake...
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you never had
Everything learned forgotten and dead
Everything turns to nothing
And when you wake...
How quickly the master
Turns into the slave
Slowly succumbing more
Every dying day
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you never had
Everything learned forgotten and dead
Everything turns to nothing
Sermon sung me slow to sleep
Faster if I had a choice
With every breath another death
Still so in love with your own voice
Idle threats to hide regrets
Excuses serve to bide the time
Cover tracks, double back
We summon silence so divine
Greeted with a thundering
absence of applause
Choke on your own words
Lies are venom in your veins
Burn from the inside
And never speak my name
Jesus complex, gag reflex
Trigger happy redundancy
No thrill, no chase, no saving grace
Hypnotic in monotony
Loaded with a salt rock shot
You say you're everything you're not
What might have been is all you've got
From here and now you're dead to me
Greeted with a thunderous
absence of applause
Choke on your own words
Lies are venom in your veins
Burn from the inside
And never speak my name
Nothing will ever erase
Or undo your disgrace
A lonely self-embrace
They've long forgotten you
Still cling to what it was
A lost and hopeless cause
Forever mourning your loss
They've long forgotten you
Murdered slowly in minute
increments of time
Pissing up a rope
Another moment passes by
Choke on your own words
Lies are venom in your veins
Burn from the inside
And never speak my name
Humanity's a failed experiment
Walking the path to extinction
Spinning it's wheels endlessly
Grease them with oil and uranium
The earth will shake
and the waters will rise
The elements reclaim what was taken
The skyline is set ablaze with regret
Ashes cover a falling silhouette
The city will reap what it's sewn and ignite
Watching as the city burns tonight
Blindly consuming mass manufactured faith
Mankind is a festering parasite
Relentlessly draining it's host dry
Nailing belief to a cross of genocide
The elements reclaim what was taken
The skyline is set ablaze with regret
Ashes cover a falling silhouette
The city will reap what it's sewn and ignite
Watching as the city burns tonight
Only after the last tree's cut
And the last river poisoned
Only after the last fish is caught
Will you find that money cannot be eaten
And everything becomes irrelevant
As the sky tears open
Fire rains down,
the fourth world comes to an end
Push the button light the match
feel the fault lines detach
Crosshairs in the evening light
I sit and watch the city burn tonight
The city burns tonight
[Digipack bonus]
A moment in time worthy only of solitude.
A stranger not meant for another to see.
Are we the abandoned?
Are we the deserter?
Lived in the night so his wickedness way.
The faces light up their screens,
as the wealthy cash in on the war.
The body counts rise, the ratings will soar.
Another deceiver.
The liar, the patriot.
Counting the lies and keeping the score.
The score.
[Pre-chorus:]
Look at the light based on faith that deserts you.
You are the hunted, the victim, the prey and the fallen.
[Chorus:]
We die alone.
A lamb in the line has been lead to the slaughter.
Another to join all the ghosts from before.
(Join all the ghosts from before.)
Another believer, another casualty.
Can't tell the way out from a drain to the floor.
The floor.
[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
[Digipack bonus]
Death lies eternal
A heathen rapture consumes the light
Impaled on its axis,
The world around me lays down to die
Immaculate contraception
The massive beating, opiate
Apocalyptic conception,
Planted, its seething reprobates
Unremitting desolation
There is no reprieve
The end goes
The angel's eyes are gouged with tragedy
The end goes
The fallen host endure mortality
The end goes
A black pasteur,
devoid of the shepherd,
where you choose to dwell
Venomous concepts,
Catalyst of damnation.
Unease filtered through chemical haze
(You're so far gone.)
Sole purveyor of your own unrest.
Go cry on the shoulder of your god
(You're so far gone.)
The catalyst of damnation.
A lone voice in the void,
There is no reprieve.
The end goes
No answer will be found to the endless Why
The end goes
Deeds done in darkness will always come to light
The end goes.
A black pasteur,
devoid of the shepherd,
where you choose to dwell
Venomous concepts,
Catalyst of damnation
Unease filtered through chemical haze
(You're so far gone)
Sole purveyor of your own unrest
Go cry on the shoulder of your god
(You're so far gone)
The catalyst of damnation
The nephlim walk the earth again
Primordial chaos resurrected
The divine narcotic strung-out seraphim
The catalyst, catalyst of damnation
In the code of life, a spiral death, a rattle from within
The healing sties, no answers lie in a world without end
Venomous concepts,
Catalyst of damnation.
Unease filtered through chemical haze
(You're so far gone.)
Sole purveyor of your own unrest
Go cry on the shoulder of your god
(You're so far gone)
The catalyst of damnation
[Japanese Bonus Track]
Soon come a burning,
Soon come a reaving,
Spare the rod, spoil the child,
Resume the righteous beating.
Hubris has been spoon-fed to you,
On a silver platter,
The weak will run weeping,
Delusion shattered.
No one owes you a god damn thing.
Bloated with pride, you're privileged once,
A walking portrayal, your life's fucking done,
Bloated with pride, the privileged one,
Condemn the hive.
The well's run dry,
Narcissist fills it with tears of blood.
Poison Juno's choking lapdog deepen the cut.
No one cares what the fuck you think.
Bloated with pride, you're privileged once,
A walking portrayal, your life's fucking done,
Bloated with pride, the privileged one,
Condemn the hive.
Say goodbye, worthless beginners,
Severed all reason, in a fractured mirror,
Solid stares, uneven high expectations,
A generations entitlement comes undone,
Your life is fucking done.
Your pitiful life,
Condemning the hive
So feeble inside,
Condemning the hive
Condemning the hive.
Bloated with pride, the privileged ones,
A walking portrayal, your life's fucking done,
Bloated with pride, the privileged ones,
The privileged ones.
The human confrontation, I've build a phobia.
It takes my essence somewhere,
Somewhere to take control.
I may be far from rocking.
I am the one alone.
I may be far behind lines.
And made them turn away.
I want to know, hey you, watch out!
I've made them turn to cripple, hey you, watch out!
When i will know, who'll know, back fight!
Why time would let me die to control.
I fear nothing, why don't you know!?
I rip my mind and why don't you bleed!?
I fear no one, why you turn back!?
I may not stop.
My freedom can't contain but tell me,
The pain I liberate,
Riff hostility to anyone
Has made us so much hate.
I made them turn from hate but tell me
The pain and suffering
I made them turn from hate but tell me
The pain and suffering
I... know.
[The official released booklet lyrics:]
The human condition is inherit claustrophobia
Compression of my space made complete
I would rip out my own entrails by hand just to be alone
Inanity rolls total through this sphere
Ostracized for clarity of vision
A dream unrealized of solitude that I should descend into autonomy
and know the pain of fellowship no more
I feel nothing but a lack of space
Paradox of socialization results in duress
Rife with hostility, what has caused me so much hate?
Humanity, exterminate with extreme prejudice
I'm a monster so don't walk my way.
Don't trust my smile my teeth are like knives.
I'll drag you down & suck you dry.
Don't laugh at my jokes- the punchline is murder.
Don't enjoy my touch, every caress hides a chokehold.
I'm only happy when I've ruined everything I see.
Believe everything you've ever heard about me- suck it up.
If you see me coming don't stop, just turn & walk the other way.
I will not lie about what I have done, I will not lie about what I will do to you, the sweat of my exertion is pure poison, I'm hell...
Violence a natural reaction in a society whose advances are limited to its new technology;
different only in the current mode of destructive intent.
Date has replaced real life in this world, no hope for the stop of "progress."
Inevitable bio-link implant will replace the feel of human touch.
All memory surrogates downloaded bought & sold, no true sense of self.
Impending sensory death looming near.
A number, this is what you've become.
Life digitized itemized commodified.
Ha, ha, ha, this is what you work for...
I want some hatred on through
This pain to feel you're fading
They say stop be more gentle
It seems I walk this hard trail alone
Come danger take them all
Then throw them at the walls
Lost
Why won't you let me go
What does your father feel
There is no point is your papa not living now
I'm gonna tear off the legs of the one that killed
Me the most powerfull human of all
Woe
I a missing father
An empty role
Why did this immortal good child forget me
Why'd a mans own father blow these
Heartstrings away
Thrice have I called for blood I want the undead child
Why wouldn't fate let this unborn child
Die a wooden blow
Please
Kill
Him
I am the ones & the zerosthat control commerce & file you silently far away.
I am the children starving in the gutter bellies full of unabated poverty.
I am nihilism no future base instinct realized environmental collapse.
I am life.
I am the corpse of decency crucified on a post of greed and moral decay.
I am man.
Submit & surrender unto Ceasar what is his rightful due.
Complete oppression no catharsis in emphatic contempt for all of life.
I am man.
All the fucked up things trap & punish me I cannot explain my problem.
Kill my hopeless life I cannot be hypnotized. You owe me.
Push aside the veil to welcome in the visitors.
Eyes like halogen illuminate the soma peering out of spherical night mask.
Paleolithic subconscious icons lumber through dreamscape archetype of archangel.
Terror and hubris - infants painted gauze peer through murky jars; soon I'm wearing the skin of the morning star.
Green locks my name fills an empty banner. Frank, what have you gotten me into now?
I am not afraid to speak my heart & mind it cannot be saved sell me over.
Fuck your hopeless world, I am blacker than the sun.
Tragedy. Have you seen the speedy, yes?
Bleeds through the sleep onto the page. I'm sailin'...
The dark crow man sits and stares into the oblivion into cold into nothingness; it's snowing in his mind.
He's created himself in his own image. Lust held for him means naught, a knock on the door brings no smile to his cruel lips;
the welcome in a woman's eyes holds nothing for him.
Alone on his haunches the hair raises on the back of his neck. His dead eyes pierce the night.
As his gaze falls down on the city it fills him the method ascertained, conviction.
He knows what to do and moves to commit the deed.
The sore on the edge of your mouth it mirror the ones on your arm of black tar you've known the ripping.
And I've seen you pissing your condition into the dirt.
I know you don't want to live in the dirt you want to know nothing but dirt you know you can't beat weakness.
Kill the flux. Stretched to breaking an obscene canvas on a stretcher of parasitism.
You piece of shit I won't say your name but I will say this - FUCK OFF AND DIE (sooner the better).
You've shot out your eyes but I'm seeing that you cannot feel anything of worth.
Know that you've pissed life away, lost in your narcotic dreams.
Heart pumping futile shit through your veins.
Why does it bother? I want to punch in your sunken face and see your dusty blood smear through the air in a polluted crimson arc,
splattering in a useless pattern on the concrete.
Moribund.
Intrinsic rot. Traces of future. Your past will rise haunting you again.
Tounging the glue stamp seal of your fold.
Cased in forests of black steel rod.
Vines of nerve float downstream. Sections of horror.
This is something you must never do again.
Falling spiral down. You know not what you are looking for but it will find you anyway.
I've confessed this disease to you. Handed you a key to control.
Fuel for your malicious intent.
Punish me for my failure. Dissect my faith. Twisting my trust.
Never, no more, I'm alone.
Hate. Falling three feet to the ground.
Face down on the cold floor of a well-oiled SF pigsty I met my one true love.
Feel youth crushed somewhere between concrete & boot, another victim of the lower hate.
You are not my god. You think this is funny don't you pig?
How the helpless freak squirms beneath our state sanctioned soles, but what is he laughing at?
There was nothing padded about a wagon full of mace.
Rotator cuff hyper extends behind my back ribs cracking beneath a rain of sticks & heels falling down like the rain outside.
Oh yeah bitch, I'm gonna remember your face your name your number;
and when I crawl out of this hole I'm going to make you all mine.
The knowledge that seeking the favor of another
Means the murder of self.
This is the resolution
The end of all progress
The death of evolution
It bleeds all life away.
Silence speeds the path to the streams of solace that run so few and narrow.
Brooks that babble the sounds of torture.
You will one day rise
To flood the banks of the chosen.
This is the art of ruin.
This is the resolution
The end of all progress
The death of evolution
It bleeds all life away.
I will show you all that I have mastered
Fear. Pain. Hatred. Power.
This is the art of ruin.
The fiends have gagged a generation of pacified fools
Bound by our greed a nation enslaved as corporate tools.
Arise and raze the legacy of their lies
To realize that this in itself is an ascension
Towards the day we revolt.
As the seeds you've cast away take hold
War will be born.
Rejoice, the age of the fall has begun
We'll dance as the palaces burn.
A shot gun blast into the face of deceit
You'll gain your just reward.
We'll not rest until the purge is complete
You will reap what you've sown.
My redemption lies in your demise.
In such a world as this does one dare to think for himself?
The paradox of power and peace will destroy itself
To know the truth and live in fear of no man.
To realize that this in itself is an ascension
Toward the day we revolt.
As the seeds you've cast away take hold
War will be born.
Rejoice, the age of the fall has begun
We'll dance as the palaces burn.
My redemption lies in your demise.
Rejoice, the age of the fall has begun.
We'll dance as the palaces burn.
Can the pestilence within you be bled out
May I have the honor of this amputation?
Know that you have made an enemy
To show you the meaning of indignity
I live now solely for the pleasure of your slow decay.
Feel the pain of vengeance burn you,
Soon you shall know silence.
With trembling hands you'll beg for mercy.
I'll show you none.
Purified by my hand
In this my world
It is salvation.
Your futile existence draws to a close
A cloak of lies drops.
The lies drop.
The hour of reckoning draws near
Judgment day is here and gone
Sweetly she draws me into her arms
A liquid embrace to chase the day way.
Sedate Numb Deaf and Dumb
Stumbling into solitude.
A clouded judgment day is fueled.
Take me under your black wings
Mark my words and remember me.
So sweetly she shucks away at my time
So sweetly she draws me nigh
Closer and closer towards never ending sleep
Spin the bottle
Kiss only the bottle.
The dark mistress of many, beholden to none
Slips a ring of needles around your arm in an engagement
Eternal engagement
Never consummated.
Take me under your black wings
Mark my words and remember me.
Destroyer of senses.
So take as needed for the pain
Another gray morning dawns across an ashen sky.
My sweet demoness beckons me
Ever again and again and again and again.
The dark mistress of many, beholden to none
My sweet demoness beckons me
Ever again and again and again and again and again.
Take me under your black wings.
Jacked up on the taste of self-destruction.
Welcome home to my reality.
So you taste yourself every time?
This must be your pleasure
This your swan song I'll sing for you.
I'll cut the words from your mouth
You'll never speak my name again.
Locked up and sold the fuck out
Don't think you won't see me again.
It'll come back three times
Once in the name of deceit
Twice for your malice
Three times when I take you away.
This is a homicide daydream
I won't waste my hate on you.
All that you've claimed not to be
Has now come to define you.
It'll come back three times
Once in the name of regret
Twice for your envy
Three times when I take you away.
Turn on my heels
And spit apathy on this bridge you have burnt.
Feast on my own blood
I'll drain myself to sleep.
I'll rise from death to knife this beast
These last regrets the ones I keep.
It'll come back three times
Once in the name of deceit
Twice for your malice
Three times when I take you away.
Watch the broken common man
Drown his sorrows at unhappy hour.
Dirty and sweaty
With just enough to get by.
Calluses on his hands calluses on his soul
Hard-boiled son of a bitch
Scraping away on the down hill grind.
It's a means to an end, a mean end for most.
Death and domestication ends in shattered hopes
Can't see the hand at the other end of the leash.
Turn and bite.
Turn and bite the hand that bleeds you dry.
Throw yourself a bone, no one else will.
Compromise leads to self-loathing
Money the excrement of labor.
And you don't get to keep shit
Except politics and power trips and a bad breath down your neck.
I know
For I have toiled in the halls of the mighty
And not received a teardrop in a bucket.
Motherfuck it.
The world doesn't owe me a thing
But you do (Motherfucker).
So crooked when you die they're gonna have to screw your ass into the ground.
As life slowly unravels
With nothing to show but wasted time and dust
A thousand points of lies falling on the deafened funeral eardrums of the blind masses.
Rise above, extract your life.
Will you look within
Then turn around and bite?
Day by day the mask suffocates your life
Is this any way to live?
No fucking way.
Down south soldier
Third world soldier
My vengeance will be swift and terrible
Many will die.
I am the distance between two points
Forgotten. A Void.
I dig holes brother.
Well, I've got a bone to pick
And a nerve to pluck
A skin to get under
And a home to wreck.
I've got ends to meet
So I've got a job to do.
Acrimonious and sanctified
Call me what you will.
Stick to your guns
The difference is mine are loaded.
Taste the sting of your arrogance
Stuck in this screeching bitch called life
Drop the coins and send you to Charon.
I will have my vengeance
In this life or the next.
Well, I've got a sucker to punch
And a back to stab
A head to kick in
And a throat to slit.
I've got a job to do
Harsh and unrepentant.
Acrimonious and sanctified
Call me what you will.
Step back before you're the next to get served
With some Southern hospitality.
Returning to solace
So sweet like honeysuckle on the tongue
The sound of silence blesses my ears
Enveloping like the earth I will one day lie in
Metropolis is bad to wither the soul
Roaring concrete and steel washes you in blood.
So let you point and laugh
Provincial ain't so bad.
Take me back down to where I belong
To rust in rivers.
I do not covet any man's life
I know my place all too well
One man's paradise is another man's living hell.
To each their own
Generation's ago made this place my own
The roots are deep and strong
Carry them wherever I go.
Never wanted your approval
Never wanted your acceptance
Never wanted to be anything but me
Never wanted to be anywhere but here.
Carry me Southeast bound home
To speak in defense of our good name
Lay me to rest with my kin
In the ground of God's country.
Lash out at any who would smear you with hate
Deify no one, never crawl ashamed
The past screams injustice on Southern night wind
Whips manacles chains musket balls
A dark history never forgotten
Only misconception remains.
Speak in defense of our good name
The blood of kin grants absolution
I'll join them soon enough in the ground of God's country.
Never wanted your acceptance
Never wanted your approval
Never wanted to be anything but me
Never wanted to be anywhere but right here.
A shallow little jackal of a man posing as a hawk.
Conniving opportunist
Lease the blade the gun the bomb in the name of justice.
A violent panacea for what ails the nation
In advancement for the pig.
You'll not wrest the truth from my hands
Eyes never closed clarity.
Clamped down in a grip so tight on ordinary horror.
Peering through a curtain of blood.
Retribution or vengeance it matters not which
As long as the pig stays on top of the ladder of bone his father has built.
Ashes to ashes to the dust
Eaten spiced with ambivalence.
The nation swallows it all whole
Weakened by their collective neck in the noose.
Commerce brings war
Jihad has come to both sides.
Eye for an eye fire for fire
Raining death as the towers crumble.
This will never end.
Left without a choice
By the fiscal elite
War is set in motion by higher powers.
A pissing contest for the unknown.
Left bankrupt we all die inside.
As a couple jumps hand in hand to their death.
Wrapped in swaddling lies and laid in a dumpster
Spoon fed shit doesn't even turn their stomachs.
Gaping mouths yawn for more abuse
Someone needs to tip the nest.
The pig ascends
As I sink deeper
Seething misanthropic
Waiting for my death.
Our father thy will be done.
I have denied this life its worth
I will not be the victim.
Sickness to you my master
Here's to getting worse
Hope it kills you faster.
Show me how it hurts to rot from the inside out.
This vigil burns
Until the day our fires overtake you.
Our father we forsake you.
Blessed be his name
Nothing now the same.
Ask me why I hate
Why I've prayed to see the nation that I loved disintegrate
And gladly give my life
That revolution regenerates.
In honor of the strife of those who've died
In generations before for your blood stained glory
I reject you
I deny you
I defy you to continue.
Smite the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered.
Under the lights where we stand tall
Nobody touches us at all
Showdown, shootout, spread fear within, without
We're gonna take what's ours to have
Spread the word throughout the land
They say the bad guys wear black
We're tagged and can't turn back
You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're taking over this town
Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen well my friend, you see
It's a pistol is down below aimed at you
We're the cowboys from hell.
Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell
Deed is done again, we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hell
Pillage the village, trash the scene
But better not take it out on me
'Cause a ghost town is found
Where your city used to be
So out of the darkness and into the light
Sparks fly everywhere in sight
Can't lock me in your cage
You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're taking over this town
Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen well my friend, you see
It's a pistol is down below aimed at you
We're the cowboys from hell.
Deed is done again, we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hell
There's a double standard for the way we live
If there's nothing to have, well then there's nothing to save
I'll break a sweat and I don't regret
What you'd kill to see brings out the god in me.
Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete sledge
The man of a thousand retirements
Will always be the one to tell you when to quit
I won't take stock in a withered man
I'm reaching into you, I'll make you understand
Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete sledge
Empty and sweating
Head lying in your hands
Shaking in the corner
Done too much alcohol
Gotta get away from it all
'Cause it feels my blood is freezing
My self insanity has taken its toll
Frustration has taken its control
Now I'm far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set my demons free
Been put to the test
My mind laid to rest
I'm on a psycho holiday
Shot down on sight
You are the target of attention
One woman here another there
You can't please all the people all the time
Can't tell the strangers
From the friends you know
Frustration has taken it's control
Now you're far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set your demons free
Been put through the test
Your mind laid to rest
You're on a psycho holiday
I'm strapped in for life
Is this where I lived
Or where I died
You want my money
You take my space
My mind is telling me
To leave this place
My self insanity has taken its toll
Frustration has taken its control
Now you're far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set your demons free
Been put through the test
Your mind laid to rest
You're on a psycho holiday
Here we are
In a world of corruption
Human nature is
Of violent Breed
Who cares if there's no tomorrow
When I die for my future's
Laid out for me
Can't you see?
Rise above the lies
Morals on a backwards globe
A sin to you
For me it's hope.
It's my life and provision
Black or white
Some pay to pray
You question why they
Act this way
It's their fucking decision
No more judgement day
Only tranquility
Peace signs, protest lines
Mean nothing to me
Honesty born in me
Heresy
I know what's right or wrong
And my belief is stronger
Than your advice
People, they go to war
Because religion gives them
Reason to fight
Sacrifice, die for pride
A group that caters
No one's fees
Or synthetic deities
Is where I belong
My stand is the human race
Without a label or a face
So they can lick my sack
No more judgement day
Only tranquility
Peace signs, protest lines
Mean nothing to me
Honesty born in me
Heresy
Reverend reverend is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins
An image beneath me
Whats within our plans for life
It all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world
Left in my misery...
The reverend he turned to me
Without a tear in his eyes
It's nothing new for him to see
I didn't ask him why
I will remember
The love our souls had
Sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see
Now is your (face)
Well I guess
You took my youth
I gave it all away
Like the birth of a
New-found joy
This love would end in rage
And when she died
I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul
You left me incomplete
All alone as the
Memories now unfold.
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the
Cemetery gates
Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free
Belong to me at last
Through all those
Complex years
I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own
And when she died
I should've cried and spared myself some pain...
Left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain
The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates
Agony is the price
That you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you
Then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel
And manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget
When there's nothing else
Left to destroy
It's a useless ploy
Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall
It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination a now blacked heart
Is reaching out divinity
Body suspended by chains over razors
And nails it's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail
Marks the demise of your life.
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
'Til your end forcing you to bend
Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall
It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination a now blacked heart
Is reaching out divinity
Body suspended by chains over razors
And nails it's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail
Marks the demise of your life.
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
'Til your end forcing you to bend
It's storming broken glass, corpses left in piles
Ungracious bludgeonmnet that breaks the earth for miles
Nothing can stop it, the day has come, from below it's catastrophic
Freezing, there's no healing families are dying
This world is shattered... all shattered
Life crushing turbulence, this wrath can't be denied
Wishing you could help your friends, standing where they died
Echoes haunting, a hollow planet, lacerations, dissected nation
Freezing, there's no healing everyone is dying
This world is shattered... all shattered
Sometimes I know
I feel untouchable
Drowning in life
Caught up in the accessible
Back down the ground
I hear the sound
there's no escape
The concrete cloud
Spilling on me
Drenching me with
Laymen's sins
I hear the sirens
From the back of me
I'm crashing face first
Into the glass eye
Clash with reality
It rears it's ugly head
Clash with reality
The indescribable
Let the dogs lie
Where we sleep
Irrelevant theme
A situation and there's
Nothing but right
In kicks the door
Nobody moves
'Cause in walks the problem
Dictates your fate
Evicts, convicts
Who'll sign the writ of life?
This now becomes
Their morbid game
Who's piss poor excuse
Is this for a world?
It swells my hatred
Day by day
Clash with reality
It rears it's ugly head
Clash with reality
The indescribable
Let the dogs lie
Where we sleep
Irrelevant theme
Many distant miles away
Past the shores of ever dark
There stays a magic man
Who bears an evil mark
He helps all concerned
Those who come again return
Injecting lies while fires burn
The devil's heart
With angel's words
Have you wondered
What heaven's like?
He can show you in one night
Overwhelming with euphoric lift
To lure you to steal your gift
Intoxication
Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go
Understand just take his hand
He's the medicine man
Once proud and fearless men
With desire in their eyes
Lost strong and fruitful lives
To self-indulgent ties
Their souls were dipped in venom
And put into a box
Then placed upon a crowded shelf
Where countless souls now rot
Have you ever wondered what hell's like?
He can take you there
Just one taste and you'll be back
And by the high you'll swear
Intoxication
Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go
Understand just take his hand
He's the medicine man
There's a place that I keep deep inside me
It can trigger my mind
All along I knew it has been with me
Since I was just a child
I just summon power within my soul
It has given me life, beyond life I take
Blame for my murderous problem my signature
Always reminds
It's a message in blood
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain,
And your godforsaken ending to life
I'm provoked into sick confrontations, brutal
Time after time, bed of nails, suffocation,
life's ending, slay in different designs
One mans misery is another mans mystery
No one cares to understand my
Demented means
Sticks and stones can break all your
brittle bones, epitaph written at your feet
It's a message in blood
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain,
And your godforsaken ending to life
Understanding what has
Happened before us
We are confined to a
Darkened hidden tomb
The conquering of our world
As we knew it
Rise above this pit
Of sorrow and pain
Among the few
We are the avant leaders
We've got to live
Through this trouble and decay
This question haunts my mind
Will we survive this night?
We're harboring the meek
Will we survive the sleep?
Unsure and scared
We are planning our reprise
Revolves around this world
We don't know anymore
The odds against us
Yet we're stronger and prevailing
Learn from mistakes
Counting souls for sale
This question haunts my mind
Will we survive this night?
We're harboring the meek
Will we survive the sleep?
Unity is a rare thing
Blind eyes of society bring
The category of minority
Now what are we supposed to be?
Born free to be
Powerless to change the world
With our lives in the hands of madmen
Now in times when society needs us
This is where the sin begins
We're aware they're going to free us
Rage from our hearts within
Born of this world
Which is a living hell
But we'll be closer to heaven
So now, this is the art
To shred... it's only emotion
Revenge
I'm screaming revenge again
Wrong
I've been wrong for far too long
Been constantly so frustrated
I've moved mountains with less
When I channel my hate to productive
I don't find it hard to impress
[Pre]
Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me
[Chorus]
Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined
Possessed
I feel a conquering will down inside me
Strength
The strength of many to crush
Who might stop me
My strength is in number
And my soul lies in every one
The releasing of anger can better any medicine under the sun
[Pre]
[Chorus]
There comes a time within everyone to close your eyes to what's real
No comprehension to fail
I vacuum the wind for my sail
Can't be the rest
Let others waste my time
Owning success is the bottom line.
Like a knife into flesh
After life is to death
Pulling and punching the rest of duration
NO ONE can piss on this determination
Now a new look in my eyes my spirit rise
Forget the past
Present tense works and lasts
Got shit on
Pissed on
Spit on
Stepped on
Fucked with
Pointed at by lesser men
[Pre]
New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials
[Chorus]
A new level of confidence and power
Demanding plea for unity between us all --
United stand
Death before divided fall
In mock military order
Vulgar
Power
Impatient
Because time is shorter
[Pre]
[Chorus]
No fucking surrender
Can't lose
Life kills
Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence
One step from lashing out at you...
You want in to get under my skin
And call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you
What do I do?
[Pre:]
Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself, by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time
[Chorus:]
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends that sympathize
Can you hear the violins playing your song?
Those same friends tell me your every word
[Pre]
[Chorus:]
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
No way punk!
[Solo]
[Chorus:]
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
Walk on home, boy!
Almost every day
I see the same face
On broken picture tube
It fits the attitude
If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate
Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules
For you to know about yourself
Not lie and make you believe
What's evil is making love
and making friends
and meeting God you're own way
The right way
[Chorus]
To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile
We stand alone
The truth in right and wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets man
My mom got jumped -- they ran!
Now I'll play a public servant
To serve and protect
By the law and the state
I'd bust the punks
That rape steal and murder
And leave you be
If you crossed me
I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a god
[Chorus]
Come meet your maker, boy
Some things you can't enjoy
Because of heaven/hell
A fucking wives' tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching say your prayers
Cause God is everywhere
Now I'll play a man learning priesthood
Who's about to take the ultimate test in life
I'd question things because I am human
And call NO ONE my father who's no closer that a stranger
I won't listen
[Chorus]
If ever words were spoken
Painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life
All I wanted
Was the keeping
Of someone like you
As it turns out
Deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you
Never ending pain, quickly ending life --
[Chorus]
You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love
I'd been the tempting one
Stole her from herself
This gift in pain
Her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you
I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself --
[Chorus]
No more head trips
We've got no time to lose
Your news is old news
Hate this, hate me, hate this
Right approach for the wrong
It's time to spread the word
Let the voice be heard
All of us, one of us, all of us
Dominate and take the motherfucking world
Mass prediction, unification
Breathing life into our lungs
EVERY creed and EVERY kind
To give us depth for strength
Taught when we're young to hate one another
It's time to have a new reign of power
Make pride universal so no one gives in
Turn our backs on those who oppose
Then when confronted we ask them the question
What's wrong with their mind?
What's wrong with your mind?
[Chorus]
It's time to RISE
We've lived with past mistakes
And we've lived with our own
Forgive, forget forgive
Be a man, not a child
There are to tears for peace
Of the common sympathies
Educate, reinstate, educate
A thing of past
The trouble in the states
It's time to rise
In the states
There's a problem with race
Because of ignorant past burned fires
From evolution
We've been killing each other
I figure man should have it down to a science
No chance
Not for a minute
Not for a second
I won't be defensive
I'm straight out in my opinion
You'd better listen to a man who knows what he is saying
I've seen your side
You run and hide for the mere fact that you feel inferior
Be superior
And know your interior
[Pre]
Race, pride, prejudice
Black man, white man
No stand
Live in the past
We make it last
A hated mass
No solution
Mind pollution
For revolution
[Chorus]
So low behold my eyes
This land of fools will rise
No good
For no one
You blame oppression and play the role of criminals
To rape and burn show progress is minimal
White hoods and militants you know it's such a pity
Living, breathing
Violence in your city
If one man
Had one home
In one world
Held live alone without variety
Full of anxiety
No one to point at, question
Or even talk to -- in his private grave
No matter what color
He wouldn't be saved from hell
He dwells
A closed mind playing the part of prison cells
[Pre]
[Chorus]
Full of grief I scream at the wind
Thought I heard the words of others
Imprison myself
And stay in a shell
I won't let you in to have a story to tell
Things tend to drag me down
Don't understand so they hate me now
[Chorus]
My fear grips the will of stone
My grip fears I'll die alone
I promised myself somewhere in the teenage life
I'd never submit to the ones I will not be like
Live in a hole
But stay close to my kind
Cause they understand what burns in my mind
I still feel incomplete
Friends are few and far between
[Chorus]
I've trampled on that road
That you think you own
You have that "smart ass" attitude
It's time to stop the fiction
I live it every day
While your mind's far away
I'm out here putting pride on the line
And you case on me with pure respect
One chance at one thing
Hard time is coming
My time, your pain
I reign on you
[Pre]
You think you own
I take away
Take it with me
You think you own
I took away
Made it my own
[Chorus]
Most regular people would say it's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this
The so many times
You practice in your mirror
To be just like me
But you just can't see
You ain't got the balls, son
I fight for love of brother
Your friends fight one another
You can't see because your head's up your ass
And just in case you think you're bad
I crush your rush
I rule YOU fool
I'm immovable stone in your world of weak -- I speak
[Pre]
[Chorus]
Serving the faith
Abduction the oath
It lie in wait for the offering
Religion is old
For drawing the young
Purity withers and dies
Never return to the ones that provided
Children draining parents of will
I hold out my hand to bloodless child
I'm taken by the one I was saving
From death
[Chorus]
By demons be driven
Beckon the call
With decline in mind
End not far
We're left hanging alone here
He pulls us from nails
Shatters our bones
Leaving us crippled and strewn
Boiling my corpse in the blood of his children
Praying for his god to prevail
Burying us with loved ones
To sleep with shelled children of the sixth dimension
[Chorus]
What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like brothers
Talked for hours last month
About what we wanna be
I sit now with his hand in mine
But I know he can't feel...
No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead
I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
Lord how we miss him
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions
No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead
He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone
A shell of my friend
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul
He sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above
Mad at God
He as hollow as I converse
I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through
I want to come in after you
My best friend
He as hollow as I alone
There is nothing.
No education.
No family life to open my arms to.
You'd say that my job is today, yet gone tomorrow.
I'll be broke in a gutter.
I know the opinion.
A broken record.
Fuck you and your college dream.
Fact is we're stronger than all.
You're working for perfect bodies,
perfect minds and perfect neighbors.
But I'm helping to legalize dope on your pristine streets
and I'm making a fortune.
You're muscle and gall.
Naive at best.
I'm bone, brain and cock.
Deep down stronger than all.
A sad state of affairs.
A crippled America.
A pipe dream buttfucked.
Immune. Stronger than all.
A lament for a rookie officer, punk ass weak little lamb.
For the mob, truly, does rule at this particular time.
We've grown into a monster.
An arrogant, explosive motherfuck.
Hard as a rock. Shut like a lock.
Finally, the president in submission.
He holds out his hand on your television and draws back a stump.
It's too late for some, far too late.
No more holdbacks. No more paying a cops paycheck.
Let him bust his own child.
The son that heeds my word and smokes my dope.
The daughter that sucks me off and snorts cheap anything.
Hail Kings.
The new Kings.
Stronger than all.
A simple process to legalize.
There would not be a choice but to take our side.
Be there no question of certain strengths.
Know this intention.
Forever stronger than all.
A long time ago I never knew myself.
Then the memory of shame birthed its gift.
No more. The small one, the weak one, the frightened one.
Running from beatings, deflating.
I'm becoming more than a man.
More than you ever were.
Driven and burning to rise beyond Jesus.
I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize
I found my life was slipping through my hands.
Perhaps through death my life won't be so bad.
I can see you, can fuck you, inside of you.
Staring through your eyes.
Belittle your friends to serve me, to suck me,
To realize my saving grasp.
I of suicide.
I the unlord.
I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize
I see you had your mind all made up
you group of pitiful liars.
Before I woke to face the day,
your master plan transpired.
Something told me
this job had more to meet the eye.
My song is not believed?
My words somewhat deceiving?
Now I'm unwhole.
[bridge:]
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are.
Can't leave the scar.
You cry for compensation.
I ask you please just give us...
[chorus:]
I read your eyes, your mind was made up.
You took me for a fool.
You used complexion of my skin
for a counter racist tool.
You can't burn me
I've spilled my guts out in the past.
Taken advantage of
because you know where I've come.
My past.
[bridge]
[chorus]
[solo]
[chorus]
I ask you please just give us
I wonder if we'll smile in our coffins
while loved ones mourn the day,
the absence of our faces,
living, laughing, eyes awake.
Is this too much for them to take?
Too young for one's conclusion, the lifestyle won.
Such values you taught your son.
That's how.
Look at me now.
I'm broken.
Inherit my life.
One day we all will die, a cliched fact of life.
Force fed to make us heed.
Inbred to sponge our bleed.
Every warning, a leaking rubber,
a poison apple for mingled blood.
Too young for one's delusion the lifestyle cost
Venereal Mother embrace the loss.
That's how
Look at you now.
You're broken
Inherit your life.
I fucked your girlfriend last night.
While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love.
She called me Daddy.
And I called her baby when I smacked her ass.
I called her sugar when I ate her alive till daylight.
And I slept with her all over me,
from forehead to ribcage I dripped her ass.
Sometimes I thought you might be spying,
living out some brash fantasy, but no.
You were knocked out.
But we were all knocked out you know.
In a way
I serve too many masters.
We didn't know you'd break the bottle
that the magic came in to use those jagged shards
to cut our wrists and neck.
And you'd do it too, you're that kind of dude.
But you wouldn't know what you were doing
because I didn't,
your girlfriend could have been a burn victim,
an amputee, a dead body.
But god damn I wanted to fuck.
I'm losing what's left of my fucking mind,
I serve too many fucking masters.
(I told you. I told you motherfucker)
As a child I was given the gift to entertain you.
But through blood I inherited a life that could destroy you.
I drink all day. I smoke all day.
I took your daughters breath away.
I've done it all but tap the vein.
These hard lines and sunken cheeks are text book reasons
All these Christians come alive and try to sell you
My soul for a goat, yet I'll outlive the old.
You know it's bad, some may say sad,
a hangover is inspiration.
Like a junkie I hurt for it.
A bad trip, the emptiness.
I never sleep, or always sleep
a lack of fulfillment to me is me.
The big picture.
These hard lines and sunken cheeks
are part of what the Christians mean
to immortalize my situation.
My soul for a goat. Yet I'll outlive the old.
Embrace some religion.
To get close to some undivine ejaculation point.
Simply to thy ghost I cling.
Simply to thy ghost I reject.
Simply to thy ghost I give spit.
Tempter, tempting, tempt me. Molest me.
You know that I'll submit.
For this is my weakness
and it saves me from relationships
With those Christians you know they'll sell you
my soul for a goat. Yet I'll outlive the old.
One's own Kingman,
Christ person, Woman God.
At battle with a mass astrengent.
The bond that blends the weak to the wise.
It's a safe assumption
that you'd want to save me now.
But I'll never face castration.
For your sacred sow is left
slaughtered.
Brainwashed by me.
Myself influence I.
Bird brained
World saver.
A fake god rests dead inside you.
It's a safe assumption
that you'd want to save me now.
But I'll never face castration.
For your sacred sow is left
Slaughtered.
System destroyed. Exposed and unployed.
The fruit of intention
cry for their dead, but turning their head
to ignore reality's claw.
Knife to your wrist, syringe in your arm
is your ounce of prevention.
Give what you made,
And under your name on your grave, is salvation.
A big fucking joke.
Slaughter the pig, the self righteous king
for your own restoration.
God is in your chest and faith kills what is precious,
for death is unanswered.
Slaughtered.
I vent my frustration at you old man,
after years your ears will hear.
You screamed you tried,
it's words of a weakling
and promises made by a liar, drunken liar.
Now you pick up that splintered chair,
that was aiming for your head.
A head that should have been long ago kicked in by me.
Alone.
I won't lose a second of sleep for this...
Don't touch me.
No!
Ever again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Orphaned to the dope and drinks,
I learned my lesson well, somehow from you.
No tears. Can't clutch my regrets.
But these years of detachment
have left me with demons now surfacing.
I'm becoming more than nothing.
You never knew the answers to any of my questions, did you?
You made up all the answers to my unimportant existence.
But now you don't have to dump me off,
Not again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Fuck, no!
Ever again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Fuck, no!
Don't touch me
Never again
I vow, lest I die tomorrow...
You'll never be the father I am.
The bastard father to the thousands
of the ugly, criticized, the unwanted.
The ones with fathers just like you.
We're fucking you back.
I'm shoving my life right down your throat.
Can I find the guts?
Can I feel the heart?
Look at the ground as you choke me up,
does it taste like tequila?
Or failure?
We're fucking you back
Fucking you back
We're fucking you back
Fucking you back
I don't want you to look at me while
I'm shedding skin.
I can't afford for you to see what's in.
I'd rather shoot myself than have you watch me.
I feel you'd steal my skin to try and wear me.
I was betrayed, one more day of my short life.
You were carried away. You had no shame.
To suffocate my being.
I was me, but you weren't you.
You were sticking to me like a scab...
so I peeled you away, and bled for days.
Then stepped out of myself.
I'm shedding skin, changing within, I'm falling in.
Through swollen eyes, I dreamed you died, caught inside.
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem.
I created the end, I'm killing a friend. I'm shedding my skin.
I don't think you belong in here,
I feel I'm sick.
Don't ask because you know damn well where I've been.
I've kept a simple woman through the thick and thin.
But I've found the guts to sever from my Siamese twin.
I throw you away. Everyday. A dead part of life.
Strangling back. Seething black.
In between my longing for torture.
Blood on my face that came from your face.
The mix of kissing and bleeding.
I put you away. I shut you away.
I pissed you away. I threw you away.
I'm shedding skin, changing within, I'm falling in.
Through swollen eyes, I dreamed you died, caught inside.
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem.
I created the end, I'm killing a friend. I'm shedding my skin.
You're fucking, and sucking.
You're friendless. It's endless.
Your flower has soured.
It's endless. You're friendless.
It's harder. And stronger.
But no one's been inside you longer.
Or harder. Or deeper.
To get you off, you need the fear.
It's never love. Bloody touch.
Broken wrist. Needle rust.
Choking throat. Swallowed teeth.
Head fuck. No peace.
I'm shedding my skin to peel you off of me.
You've got to love me.
Ornament. Shrunken head.
Playtoy. Snake strike.
Poisonous. Syphilis.
Drenched me. Soaked me.
I'm shedding my skin to drain you out of me.
You've got to hate me.
Enlight your sense of thought, of touch,
of real, a shield, an underground for this coward.
Building a blood in water scent.
It's like some raping,
without judgement.
Boy in a pocket.
Balls in a bag.
Serve and protect you.
His dick his gun, his brain his badge.
A faster way to kill them all would take too goddamn long.
Absorb through pores the great escape.
Kill that fuck to show him up.
Equal his displeasure now.
Stab his ass, a reminded past of what the fuck we live for.
Ourselves.
Arm yourself. A branch. A third arm.
Extend your health, crawl inside euphoria.
Building a blood in water scent.
It's like a scraping. It's entrapment.
Boy in a pocket.
Balls in a bag.
Perverted handle.
His getting by is a fisted fuck.
A faster way to exterminate them takes too fucking
long. Absorb through pores the great escape.
Kill that fuck to show him up.
Equal his displeasure now.
Stab his ass, a reminded past of what the fuck we live for.
Ourselves.
Half-assed for most his life.
Piss poor little ham.
Narc boy a fake fuck limp dick.
Sucking up to the man.
And the world.
We need a fucking cold war.
Building a blood in water scent
It's like a raping
Without judgement
Boy in a pocket
Balls in a bag
Perverted handle
His dick his gun, his brain his badge
Kill that fuck to show him up
Equal your displeasure now
Stab his ass a reminded past of what the fuck we're living for
Our fucking selves!
This is feeding what I am.
It's like salt poured into a deep, infected wound.
It's the type of pain you really dig and long for.
I've always been insecure to open up and show love.
Some pretty girl with long hair, some bald guy writhing.
Rejection...
The kind that's self induced.
The tongue that's bitten through.
The nauseating stab.
Is feeding what I am.
A short fuse.
If there really is a god, then it's punishing me constantly.
She let me taste that sugarhole and of course, I wanted more.
But no. I'm reduced to a Rohypnol snort and a lot of drinks.
This shit goes on and on. Just look down my pants.
Rejection...
It ain't a fucking game.
My human dick to blame.
A sociopathic plan.
Is feeding what I am.
Rejection...
Takes life away from eyes.
Will give you to the skies.
It makes me more than a man.
Is drowning what I am.
[Black Sabbath song taken from the Paranoid album]
We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The moon in silver trees
Falls down in tears
Light of the night
The earth, a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always
While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks down the night
And so we pass on by the crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel the universe
[Bonus track]
[Poison Idea cover]
Young and dumb, truth and justice, fantasy
Fresh out of the academy
Five-time loser bust his head, make your day
Unless you're paid off then you look away
Do you think this corruption will ever stop
What makes a person want to be a cop
Ran a red light, storm the house and bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry
Pick up a hooker and take her for a little ride
But get sucked off on the side
Sworn to serve and protect, forget the killing
Badge-wearing fascist villain
Pissed in the street, you bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry
The badge means you suck
A child lies there dead
As you look back, what goes through your head
Young and tough, truth and justice, fantasy
Fresh out of the academy
Five-time loser bust his head, make your day
Unless you're paid off then you look away
He burned a flag, storm the house and bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry
Ran a red light, take her for a little ride
But get sucked off on the side
The badge means you suck
A child lies there dead
As you look back, what goes through your head
Talk to them, you can work it out
You better not even try it
You make a play for his gun
They'll kill you say it was a riot
RIOT
What's behind the badge?
Watching through a tiny hole at the humanity outside
I’ve got my questions and I’ve got my answers
Tonight someone’s gonna die
I’m excited, I’m in fury
I will have one more to bury
In a selfish act of violence
I’ll cast you to ghastly silence
Night is cold, your breath is warm, that’s how you’ve come to be betrayed
My car is expensive, my suit is so shiny
And that’s how I’ll find my mate
They’re so many at the counter
I choose which I want to slaughter
Have a drink on me, don’t worry
For this night you won’t be sorry
Mutilated, enslaved and raped
Lacerated, strangled, impaled
As you wake up on the bed tied and undressed to my delight
I start to dress up, I get my equipment
What? Why are you so shy?
You look so intimidated
Being slowly penetrated
With my hatchet and my wimble
Does your life now seem so simple?
Mutilated, enslaved and raped
Lacerated, strangled, impaled
Tired of this world
This never ending hide-n-seek
We all are told
To swallow down their politics
Politics
The only way is
To end this constant suffering
In bitter sadness
I hang a stone up my worn out neck
No more questions
About my past identity
Since now, and on
I’ve morphed into nobody
Nobody
Something’s changing
For some there’ll be no tomorrow
This world is wicked
Your souls are filled with sorrow
Run
While you can!
Dripping ceiling
Raw meat and water is my food
A strange feeling
Let loose and I shall do no good
No chance to break
The chains that hold me inside this cell
Challenge accepted
I wish to bite the feeding hand
Light
The door open wide
Headband
Covers my eyes
Laughter, dogs barking loudly at me
Smell of eight people, not too many for me
Finally unchained, the band removed
Gun shots in the air, and I am told to run
Dogs unleashed, I turn and break their spines
Running back to those who dared change my life
Something’s changing
For some there’ll be no tomorrow
This world is wicked
Your souls are filled with sorrow
Run
While you can!
Terror on their faces is best kind of surprise
Frozen in their places – no one tries to run
With wildly glimpsing eyes I rend their tender throats
I feast on their meat and blood and move on,
I want more!
Weird colors around
Creatures so wonderful
They’re emerging from nowhere
And melting away to nowhere
Flowers of ice and mud
Reaching for the sun -
A diamond in dust, shining black 
On the sky of velvet
Do you trust your eyes?
Can this all be lies?
Do you trust your brain?
Do you want to stay?
Wandering through this scenery
Still looking forward to escape
Eyes badly clogged up with that dust
Skies yellow, acid shower starts 
Run for your life 
And take cover or die 
Acid melts you 
Like ice flowers are melted 
With hot water 
Dig yourself deep
Into the mud, create comfort
Inside the core of this raging 
Goddamn planet
Do you trust your eyes?
Can this all be lies?
Do you trust your brain?
Do you want to stay?
Can you feel the heat
The core erupting energy
Can you hear the sound
Your brain’s bursting out
Listen to the sound, listen to the sound
Brain’s bursting out, brain’s bursting out
Blood and sticky slush covering the walls
All remains removed, process fully logged
Do you trust your eyes?
Can this all be lies?
Do you trust your brain?
Do you want to stay?
All test results marked as classified
Great setbacks forestall great advance
New strains of serum will be tried
Mind crashing power dominance
Mind crashing power dominance
Mind crashing power dominance
Just in time to see the show
You’ve come to this deep concrete basement
People standing in a row
All eager to receive my blessing
As I fill my glass with wine
They raise their hands, that’s how they praise me
Innocent, they now will know
What faith looks like, they’ve come to test it
It’s so easy
Taste the wine I give you
You are thirsting, may your thirst be quenched tonight
It’s so easy
Taste the wine I give you
You are moaning in delight
Order gone, it’s an orgy
Pheromones filling the air
So excited, liberated
Under my unwinking stare
I command “release the lions”
And the secret doors come up
Raging beasts escape their cages
And begin their royal feast
Sacrificed
What an awful tragedy
Sacrificed
It’s the day you cease to be
Sacrificed
It’s so easy
Taste the wine I give you
You are thirsting, may your thirst be quenched tonight
It’s so easy
Taste the wine I give you
You are bleeding, it’s all right
Blood collected through the grating
Filtered and poured into bath
As a final stroke of my rite
I command to dim the light
Faithful servants, holding daggers
Cutting through each other’s chests
In this room now filled with corpses
I prepare to have my rest
Sacrificed
What an awful tragedy
Sacrificed
It’s the day you cease to be
Sacrificed
The fault of men
Deprived them of salvation
No one will stand
Against eradication
A finger on the button
Press to erase all memory
Death from above, so sudden
Eliminates hypocrisy
Still alive?
Not for long!
Soon or late
We’ll be gone!
Awaiting for
The missile to reach
It’s destination point
Chronology bleached
Now you are all in panic
Trying to change something you can’t
There’s no escape, you maggots
The time is now to understand
Come, you fools
Hail ye gods
World you knew
Broken down
The fault of men
Deprived them of salvation
No one will stand
Against eradication
The sky turns red
With clouds dark and thick
Nothing here reminds
Of humanity
The fault of men
Deprived them of salvation
No one will stand
Against eradication
They say I’m not like all of them
They say I’m somewhat evil
They seem to ignore me
So I will have to show them
Pleasure will be mine
No escape from the voices inside
My head goes round, it’s aching
The pain is taking strange shapes
Of the schemes I must bring into life
Yes
I’m that mad
To create
what will be
Key feature of the end
Of the End!
They won’t let me escape
They want me to obey
These annoying voices
Are forcing me to work on
And on and on and on
At last – my creation’s finished
A standard of perfection
Soon all will suffer my wrath
As I’ve assembled a monster
Feel my wrath
As I give order to attack
Yes
I’m that mad
To create
what will be
Key feature of the end
Of the End!
Pneumatic drives pushing its hands towards me
Its eyes look at my face with hatred
I embrace my death with pride
As extermination spree begins
Pleasure will be mine
Infinite
Killer
Self
Reproduction
One mistake can cost life
One mistake and you die
A scalpel in his eye,
Pain beyond his threshold
She screams so loudly: “Die!
No more tears!”
No mercy to the man
Crawling on the floor
“My beauty you have maimed,
Time to pay!”
When plastic surgery goes wrong
The patient’s looking for revenge
Under the stare of swollen eyes
The unsuccessful doctor dies
For her now all is gone
Lost career, ruined life
The damage has been done
No way back
Such murder is the least
She now can commit
The operation’s vile result
Is a beast
One mistake can cost life
One mistake and you die
And so these two have swapped the roles
The doctor’s on a patient plate
Face cut and negligently sutured
Eye for eye, future for future
Go back to when
You felt your strength
Return to what
You call triumph
Remind yourself
Of things neglected
As you’re now
Alone - rejected
Stamped by majority, Exiled from society
It all began
Nine years ago
One simple man
Just found some gold
Two tons of ore
Shitload of dollars
Corrupting him
Who wears a collar
Stamped by majority
Exiled from society
No need to work
No need to pray
Enjoying life
With no dismay
One always has
What others need
But clever ones
Keep truth concealed
Stamped by majority, Exiled from society
It was a surprise for him
Silenced and fastened to a chair he got castrated
Tongue and fingers violently cut off
And all the money taken
Now, with no means left to express his cry of madness
He’s standing on the rooftop waiting for the wind to blow
No one would believe, had he a slightest chance to spread this
His life fucked him so hard he wants his death to be no slow
Is that enough
Of pain to stand
No man’s that tough
To meet the end
With smiling eyes
But not to bend
If you’re so dumb
You’re overbade
Stamped by majority, Exiled from society
Stamped! Stamped! Stamped!
Exiled! Exiled! Exiled!
Exiled!
What is this for?
This life is not a game
You say we all
All tend to feel the same
The same question
Twitching in our heads
Give me reasons
Give me all the facts
Why am I to be like them
If I’m the one who stands above
All these white walls
This soft upholstery
These tough steel doors
Squeaking their poetry
All blank around
As will my mind become
Joyful, blissful
When their job is done
How will it be?
Fast or slow?
Painful or not?
Optimal choice
To create
Kingdom of
Unthinking vegetables
Do it! Do it!
Lobotomy!
I’m strapped to the metal surgical bed
The doctor lays out his armament
Assistants prepare
All necessary
Orbitoclast getting
Closer to me
Putting me on 
The verge of serenity
Why am I to be like them
If I’m the one who stands above
Black look, white gown
That’s now my constant state
I’m fed, I’m fine
They change my toilet
Free food, free home
Is what I’ve always wished
Live on til my 
Ferocity Unleashed
This is my kingdom
Is there a way
To save my mind
From what came out
To be my own
Second I
When it came I was asleep
Lost within my dreams so deep
All of my secret thoughts exposed
To whom to open them I chose
The strongest fortress of my mind
Was so susceptible at night
I am entrapped, I am confined
To madness confidently stride
My own reflection I now face
I tell it now to leave this place
As I speak, my words come back
I’ll wreck this fucking face, I’ll wreck
Is there a way
To save my mind
From what came out
To be myself
Woken up in fear in sweat
Bath my head with coldest water
Asking mirror “What was that”
Receiving an unwanted answer
“You are now a minor threat,
I’m your ever hiding master
Feel for that thing no regret
Now your life is a disaster”
Medicine taken in time
Swallowed, taken down with wine
So that it knows who’s the boss
Hardly keeping my eyes
Open
Is there a way
To save my mind
From what came out
To be myself
In catatonic trance I roam
I’m not the master of my dome
Divided into hostile halves
My brain pathetically starves
I know the way, the only way
And I don’t care what it will say
Now I have come to realize it
I know two brains just need two bodies
Rushing to the lumber mill
Tied up, hearing the saw wheel
Closer, closer, MAKE ME FEEL!
I WON! I welcome the cold steel!
Never should I’ve listened to this
Hidden message
Now it’s gotta be delivered
As intended
Each and every second counts now
Need to hurry
Or they will deprive my children
Of their precious lives
Outside, to the rendezvous point
Don’t make them wait
Total compliance with all the details
Don’t let them down
I brought what they told me to bring
In a briefcase
Take it and give me back what’s mine
Fear my vengeance
Today they’ll all regret they broke the promise given
As I step firmly on the path of war against all living
Exterminate mankind, deprive them of the things most valued
The weak will fall first and the strong will beg for mercy
Blood shrouding my eyes
Death I have become
Cast off my disguise
Soon you’ll all be gone
All thoughts focused now on one thing
Retribution
All the rules I used to obey
Defied and broken
Stolen samples of a deadly
Fast evolving
Virus I decided to use
As a manifest
Today they’ll all regret they broke the promise given
As I step firmly on the path of war against all living
Exterminate mankind, deprive them of the things most valued
The weak will fall first and the strong will beg for mercy
As I looked in mirror of fate
The vision showed my future life
I walked inside the abyss gate
And no longer was alive
I felt my soul in new reborn
My darkened dream became too strong
I found myself here not alone
Among the crawling painful throng
My dream of darkness waits for me
It is my passion to be free
I have seen the sun light
That was my angel
He was sliding from the height
Dressed in white stranger
He came to take me
With him to clear skies
My time has come to die
And I closed my eyes
The freezing wind is blowing from behind
The feeling of inevitability maniacally moves me
Closer to my dream that will be fulfilled enough
Under this blackened mysterious sky
I do not hear request I ignore bright light
No one will stop me now to realize my wish
Forever smelling darkness I will enjoy my choice
In the abyss – the storage of sign and souls
The last step and warm air from inside
Heats up my body in my falling down
My falling down made me cry
But pain I have felt no more
My body was encaged to die
But soul've got the evil lore
And when I closed the gate
I saw the last sign of the sun
For my returning is too late
The endless darkness had begun
My dream of darkness waits for me
It is my passion to be free
I bent over the edge
But I felt a sudden bless
Life seems like a cruel cage
My soul tormented needs the rest
The abyss calls to jump inside
The human being’s strange to me
Enthralling darkness charms my mind
The pit is my destiny
In my cold cell where I
Sleep all days and nights
Visions pass through my head
Of a Spider in web
He is living ahead and
He waits for as dead
Insect catched in his trap
Will make Spider be fed
But am I like spider
My stone-cold cage
The Spider's protected
And I'm still not yet
Forever in blindness
All life in a dream
I know, I'm a victim
Indrafted by him
I have watched all his life
And I saw the way he died
In that corner of cell
I am dying as well
Only question is "Why ?"
I forgot who am I
And I feel new fiend
Of dead spider instead
But am I like spider
My stone-cold cage
The Spider's protected
And I'm still not yet
Forever in blindness
All life in a dream
I know, I'm a victim
Indrafted by him
Just nothing more than a dream
You doesn't matter much to me
Believe in you or trust in him
I think my choice is always free
I tried, I loved you as I could
You never heard what I have sayed
The years passed, I understood
For nothing holy all we prayed
I despise
Forgive me now!
Realise
I lied myself
I despise
You know how!
Paradise
Beyond the wealth
Streams of hate and desperation
Are spinning round mother Earth
Who really knows the destination
Of sacred hope in true love?
I've got the pain of silly lies
Their trust - is how much they buy
And I was wrong, I should despise
Despise myself, my past and die...
I despise
Forgive me now!
Realise
I lied myself
I despise
You know how!
Paradise
Beyond the wealth
By the path of endless sadness
We meet new faces everywhere
We walk true way of glory
And manage vectors of success
By the path of clear feelings
Sometimes we get to very high
Enjoy every moment of life
Who knows what would be tomorrow?
Breaking the rules of saint moral
We choose another justice there
The hope to be excused and
Not to be punished doesn't stop us
In our dreams we see the fire
Eternal burden of no control
Your path is your real life
Your path is a branch from the past
Invisible hero always walks alone
He lives in anything you see
Hero is nothing more than illusion
The mask that shines on little child
Last drop of blood is the key
Maybe to the great salvation
But no people do really know
How to open the book of truth
By the path of sacred suffering
Go only young gods of no bible
If you hate then you lose your time
I know one of them and I'm proud
We show the way to all the paths
The third attempt was unseen again
Great son of mother nature
Young god Enoth is speaking wisdom
Twelfth servants of the wicked god
Magisters in the blackened robes
Gathered in the abandoned house
To accomplish ritual
Full Moon was laying in the sky
Wild wolfs were wailing nearby
Everything was ready to begin
In the morning she was found
On a table covered with the blood
Lied an ugly and sectioned mess
That someday was a body
Skull was split into seven parts
Flowed brain was slipping down
Interiors were resting in a bucket
The smell was so awful
Dancing round, praising sin
They touched the naked body
Eldest member of this cult
Profaned her sweet vaginae
With the sacrifice they live
Through the sacrifice
With the sacrifice they kill
Through the sacrifice
Idols stood on dirty wooden shelf
Pictures hung above the fireplace
Pentagram was painted with blood
Blood of former virgin
Near the cold and impediment altar
With the gold shiny turned cross
Hysterically laughing sat the boy
And held the human heart
Dancing round, praising sin
They touched the naked body
Eldest member of this cult
Profaned her sweet vaginae
With the sacrifice they live
Through the sacrifice
With the sacrifice they kill
Through the sacrifice
Thoughts of sacred future, life that never ends
Eternal power you'll get is a pitiful illusion
Inside your little room you want to be a hero
Inside your brain is a slave of hopeless power
Moon will change the Sun
Another day's begone
Come down dreamer
Escape your maze of thoughts
Maze of thoughts You are lost forever
Deep in a soul is dying one who's clever
Deep in your heart you want to be a god
But life you lived was taken by true lord
Now your flesh is dead and soul is in the hell
Aim to be over all creatures is still remaining
But death crossed out the list of vital pleasures
You were mistaken all your pitiful existence
The Earth is banished
Years passed
No mortal life exist
The radiation
Travels fast and
None could it resist
Ruined structures
Face the death
Clouds chase the light
Roads are empty
Sleeping towns
Salvation's out of sight
Nuclear Winter
Forgotten souls
Rest in peace
No god will make them live
Eternal Idol
Weapon is
The height that man achieved
Blinding strike
Of hellish storm
Child's helpless cry
The future's lost
As demon first
Condemned world to die
Nuclear Winter
Idea of Self-destruction
No savior, no mercy, no god
Time is exhausted for action
All nations are damned to rot
I hate myself when I'm alone
They say with gird "Hi is a stoned"
I like going home but all is vain
There I am stranger in the fame
My home's there, where I am
But I do hate all of them
Tell me what for I live
And I shell tell
That you are not right
You ask me why
But I shell dive
And I come back
But from myself
Nothing remained
I didn't want to stay at home alone
This morning to the madhouse I have gone
Especially the victims of the war
Have stuck my mind with show that I saw
Mentality destroyed of heavy wounds
In hours awakened under mounds
The chamber seemed like terrific blindage
In darkened light it looked just like a cage
The orders are there given every night
They execute them silently in fright
Shelters and the ground holes are beds
The sudden screams are heard in heads
It's the Imaginary Suffering
The war forgotten evermore
It's the Imaginary Suffering
The memories are stronger then the lore
In the ears of unfortunates
The scream of shells keeps on
Their eyes like five years ago
Are full of demonic horror
Bayonets will never stop
To pierce in soft stomachs
Tanks ruthlessly force down
Crying wounded bodies
And press them like flounders
In thunder of endless struggle
Explosions of hand grenades
The Crash of splitting skulls
Terrible Singing of the mines
Rattle of pressed down men
In spite of failed blindages
Everything was saved in minds
Just like from the black magic
Which was created so cruel
And is filled with Tacit Fury
In that chamber of sorrow
With turned to pale eyes
In horror they scream and cry
Choke in restrained shirts
Silent thunder-storms of chaos
Fall on there weakened minds
Jelly legless wriggling existence
Crawling deintellected creature
Life of carrion slowly drafts
To intestines, brain and breaks into
Dim disintegration of beginning
As I looked in mirror of fate
The vision showed my future life
I walked inside the abyss gate
And no longer was alive
I felt my soul in new reborn
My darkened dream became too strong
I found myself here not alone
Among the crawling painful throng
My dream of darkness waits for me
It is my passion to be free
I have seen the sun light
That was my angel
He was sliding from the height
Dressed in white stranger
He came to take me
With him to clear skies
My time has come to die
And I closed my eyes
The freezing wind is blowing from behind
The feeling of inevitability maniacally moves me
Closer to my dream that will be fulfilled enough
Under this blackened mysterious sky
I do not hear request I ignore bright light
No one will stop me now to realize my wish
Forever smelling darkness I will enjoy my choice
In the abyss - the storage of sign and souls
The last step and warm air from inside
Heats up my body in my falling down
My falling down made me cry
But pain I have felt no more
My body was encaged to die
But soul've got the evil lore
And when I closed the gate
I saw the last sign of the sun
For my returning is too late
The endless darkness had begun
My dream of darkness waits for me
It is my passion to be free
I bent over the edge
But I felt a sudden bless
Life seems like a cruel cage
My soul tormented needs the rest
The abyss calls to jump inside
The human being's strange to me
Enthralling darkness charms my mind
The pit is my destiny
The Earth is banished
Years passed
No mortal life exist
The radiation
Travels fast and
None could it resist
Ruined structures
Face the death
Clouds chase the light
Roads are empty
Sleeping towns
Salvation's out of sight
Nuclear Winter
Forgotten souls
Rest in peace
No god will make them live
Eternal Idol
Weapon is
The height that man achieved
Blinding strike
Of hellish storm
Child's helpless cry
The future's lost
As demon first
Condemned world to die
Nuclear Winter
Idea of Self-destruction
No savior, no mercy, no god
Time is exhausted for action
All nations are damned to rot
I hear your voice from illusive depths
Your step so quivering to me
The streams of cold and excitation
Are casting thirsts of divine love
You're weightless clothiers that I touch
Are derivation heavenly desires?
I gently stroke your long hair
And from your lips I gain fire
My heart is beating faster
Your arms embrace me
Just for moment of bliss
The gods took cruel fee
I see your face erasing
Your charming beauty withers
I catch your falling tears
Why are you dying in my kisses?
I'm the slaughter, I'm the beast
With the rise of moon I go
To the fields on the feast
Cruelly shooting my flame-thrower
Burn the bodies , Take the life's
With the smell of rusty bones
I enjoy their poor cries
Crushing heads with heavy stones
Who were that people?
I don't know
Now it's a bloody
BIOMASS
I need nothing, I want deaths
It's my job to paint scenes
Of artistic bloody mess
How much for me it means
Cut the fingers, smash the face
Place the parts on pentagram
Make inside it burning haze
That will be my future theme
What for I killed them
I don't know
But it's a pretty
BIOMASS
Wind that brings the death, again you recollect that wind
You feel its breath with the wave of ice through mentality
Visions of the past will emerge in the darkened cold sky
Lying on your back you try to forget endless suffering
And when the mystic black sky will embrace the planet
And the gates of flame shall appear in crack of the earth
He will come ... Wind becomes stronger in restless storm
White skull shines on the ground ... It is yours
The pain from memories and silence will rush like lightning
Sounds of loneliness you hear every minute of decay
Your grave is abandoned and the cross is hidden in cane
None sees it but the dim shadow. You recognize yourself
What does the stone monument conceal?
Pain from inside and cold existence
He will come and ice winds will dispel
The skull that crushed his leg
The shadow from cross will merge with his
Raven will rise in height from old grave
What you'll get in second you will miss
You are t he damned for eternity slave
Through many ages you see the same tormenting dream
The chains are irreconcilably rattling in the fearful darkness
Everything's merged together in that dreadful sound
Physical force is exhausted and your soul is enslaved
Through the gloom of time and the ages of deadly sleep
You will open your eyes that forgot the world you've left
The terrific dream was stopped but you feel freezing wind
Again that wind reminds you the past you were frightened of
You feel the breath from beneath the earth and ice in knees
Time for memories again calls you into the abyss of darkness
He came for your soul from the distant existence of graves
Again the similar painful cry, again a grave, but it's yours
What does the stone monument conceal?
Pain from inside and cold existence
He will come and ice winds will dispel
The skull that crushed his leg
The shadow from cross will merge with his
Raven will rise in height from old grave
What you'll get in second you will miss
You are the damned for eternity slave
Обломки домов, разрытые ямы
От безоблачных снов остались канавы
Останки крестов, спокойные звуки
Лишь через вечность забудутся муки
Никчемные люди, кровавые лица
Зловещие звезды забыли светиться
Большие кошмары, прилипшие к ранам
Теперь вся Земля отдана тараканам
Глупые войны, страшные бедствия
Не угадаешь порой все последствия
Создай им оружие, пусти их к нему
А завтра узнаешь и сам про войну
Забудешь ты все то, что можно забыть
И завтра придется кого-то убить
Раненный в спину ты будешь бежать
Выстрел еще один, придется лежать
Это война. Там не бывает иначе
Умрешь, не умрешь - как будет удача
Может, спасет тебя твоя вера в добро
А может, погубит тебя же оно
Разрывы слышны, отражаясь как эхо
Трудно остаться живым человеком
Никто не увидит, как ползают люди
Сгибаясь от боли предсмертных прелюдий
Утром затихло, не слышно разрывы
Но не надолго, пока еще живы
Оставили всех, жаждущих мести
Судьба решена, не жить им всем вм есте
До тех пор, пока существует вражда
И не остынет их злая нужда
На этой земле так и будет война
Хоть многим до смерти противна она
Быть может, когда-то люди поймут
Что в конце-то всего друг друга убьют
Того добиваются живущие выше
Играют в игру, кто дольше всех выживет
Накроет всю Землю ядерным взрывом
И сверху смотреться будет красиво
Пройдут тысячелетия, и время пролетит
И может кто-то выше нам Землю возродит
Это война. Там не бывает иначе
Умрешь, не умрешь - как будет удача
Может, спасет тебя твоя вера в добро
А может, погубит тебя же само
Разрывы слышны, отражаясь как эхо
Трудно остаться живым человеком
Никто не увидит, как ползают люди
Сгибаясь от боли предсмертных прелюдий
Twelfth servants of the wicked god
Magisters in the blackened robes
Gathered in the abandoned house
To accomplish ritual
Full Moon was laying in the sky
Wild wolfs were wailing nearby
Everything was ready to begin
In the morning she was found
On a table covered with the blood
Lied an ugly and sectioned mess
That someday was a body
Skull was split into seven parts
Flowed brain was slipping down
Interiors were resting in a bucket
The smell was so awful
Dancing round, praising sin
They touched the naked body
Eldest member of this cult
Profaned her sweet vaginae
With the sacrifice they live
Through the sacrifice
With the sacrifice they kill
Through the sacrifice
Idols stood on dirty wooden shelf
Pictures hung above the fireplace
Pentagram was painted with blood
Blood of former virgin
Near the cold and impediment altar
With the gold shiny turned cross
Hysterically laughing sat the boy
And held the human heart
Dancing round, praising sin
They touched the naked body
Eldest member of this cult
Profaned her sweet vaginae
With the sacrifice they live
Through the sacrifice
With the sacrifice they kill
Through the sacrifice
Rise up, wise up
This will not be the last of our kind
We hold something that you will never know
These numbers that can only grow
We have the power so lets use it
It's what we gotta do if we wanna survive
Stip it from those that abuse it
Don't loose sight, It's what we gotta revive
The power is in our hands
Make a move, take whats yours
Dont let it fall, Don't let it touch the floor
This is sacred with roots so deep
Keep it alive, Always water the seed..
It hurts my eyes to see such violence and chaos
So live your life 'cause that's a cross you don't gotta bear
You've got the power, you control the majority
You turn your back to hardship and poverty
In the face of disaster
You'll find no salvation
In the face of disaster
No one to save your nation
In the face of disaster
You will fall
In the face of disaster
You're gonna lose it all
Just let it run its course
Your empire will fall, without using any force
The powerful will become powerless
You'll lose control of all the people you possess
The lies wont stop
I can't take anymore
Just close my eyes
'Cause I don't wanna see aymore
I'm just livin' life, living the way I want to
It's not a question of right or wrong, I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do
You can;t, You wouldn't understand and I'm nor gonna expain to you
Tell me, show me how you feel and I'll blow it all away
Take what you can get, because I don't owe you shit
And the world will spin without you
Troubles in life will always try and hold you down
Fend for yourself and learn to turn it around
I can;t stop it, I can;t stop it, So I'm fonna go with the flow
Take life's path in which direction that I choose to go
It's my life, and I'm gonna do what I feel
Live for today, like there's no tomorrow
I can't stop it, I can't stop it, So I'm gonna go with the flow
Take life's path in which direction I choose to go
It's my life, and I'm gonna do what I fell
Live for today, like there's no tomorrow
No chance, No way, I'm not gonna give this up
There's no other way to get it across so I'm
Gonna live it up
Take a chance, roll the dice
No, no tomorrow
A brick of gold, a grain of rice
No, no tomorrow
Take a chance roll the dice
No, no tomorrow
A brick of gold, a grain of rice
No. no tomorrow
Live today like your last
No, no tomorrow
Wipe the dust off of your past
It starts at birth, always told you're the best
You're no different, You're just as good as the rest
Time moves on
And now i know just who I am
Growing up, another molded mind
Ideas coming from another kind
Different paths, It's time to choose
It's tough knowing in the end we all lose
Walks of life
Create a crutch to cope with the pain
Making decisions based on knowledge that we gain
Emotion or logic, we do what we feel is right
Life of sin, how the fuck do we sleep at night
The human being chooses a path
Working towards a better future but it won't last
Nothing real left to believe
We'll be left with nothing when we finally leave
Days pass by with no time to rest
At the day end my life is left in a mess
My past is sealed with chains and locks
I need time to sort out all my thoughts
But there's no time to rest
Because life is moving at its quickest pace
We're all ruining in this rat race
And if you can't keep up then you'll be left behind
You can't out run the hand of time
No one can outrun the hand of time
The hand of time
You can't out tun the hand of time
So live your life and don;t ever regret
Let go of the past, but never forget
You can't out run the hand of time
No one can outrun the hand of time
The hand of time
You can't out tun the hand of time
Beware this path you're choosin'
Mass confusion, all is illusion
Good & evil, right & wrong
To balance the act you gotta be strong
We're tryinf to figure out a game that they control
IF you play by the rules your future will be told
Alpha & Omega, life & death
Choose to survive, or take your last breath
Beware the path
Trace each step you take
Beware the path
Watch each move you make
To much noise in the world today
So many obstacles blinding my way
So little time yet so much to kill
So make it last, test your will
So many questions, always asking "why?"
With every truth you're given a lie
Give and take, make or break
Don't fuck it up, this is your last mistake
Beware the path
Trace each step you take
Beware the path watch each move you make
Bad things happen to good people
And that's just, just to keep it equal
You're traveling into the unkown
Beware the path when your on your own
Beware the path
Trace each step you take
Beware the path
Watch each move you make
Thrown into this worls so full of hate
I found what's right for me, I know what I believe
As long as I'm here I won't leave to see this go
Happiness under chains, It's all we'll ever know
Living on the outside, misshaped, I never fit in
From the start I never knew where, I never knew where to begin
Now it's all, it's all so clear, I know exactly where I belong
Happineess under chains, That's exactly where I belong
I'm trying to find the balancee while I search for the truth
I need to gain wisdom of untaught lessons of my youth
Happiness under chains
I found happiness locked under chains
Been around your kind for far to long
You can't see past your nose, you can't see that your wrong
Your vicious ways are going to end your life
With the crack of a bat, or the blade of a knife
You follow your tail like that of a rat
Surrounded by filth, but I can't live like that
Your mind has been guided so far from the truth
I can't understand what has happended to you
Looking for a way out, but you're already gone
The damage is done, you've done wrong
How long can you live off of the scraps of others?
Once you pick the last bone, You'll just want another
Looking for a way out, but you're already gone
The damage is done, you've done wrong
How long can you live off of the scraps of others?
How long?
What goes around, just comes back around
You're gonna get what you have coming to you
What goes around, Comes back around
It makes me ill, I wont take take any more
You dine on crumbs that lay on the floor
No hope for your diseased mind
Gonna strike you down, take back whats mine
What goes around, comes back around
With one moment of clarity
Chaos as far as I can see
In each direction around me
I will sink into the cracks
My soul cries out, for something more
Right and wrong cross me, and I'm tore
Between how I feel, and what I know
For so long, we've been mislead
So many signs that we've misread
But for now we know what's right
Inside your self, You'll find the light
My soul cries out, for something more
Right and wrong cross me, and I'm tore
Between how I feel, and what I know, And I'll overthrow
For so many years I've been asking why
And can i live the way that i want?
It's hard to chanfe the way that i work
There's gotta be another way around this fork...
Can I do it?
You prey on the weak and vulnerable
But I won't fall into your grasp
You make your ways seem more tolerable
But we all know that it will never last
No hope for your dead end path
I must focus upon myself
Before I go I hope I made it last
And know that I always thought for myself
Can I reach a higher surface?
Can I figure out my true purpose?
Can I do it?
I can, I know I can
[Lyrics: Siaska Di Borja, music: Tales Of Pain]
Come into the labyrinth
Now it´s time for you to see the light
And make your dreams come true
Take a look inside your heart and soul
Here I go, I have to find my place
In this world, I´m not insane
Help me now, don´t let me die again
I never felt something like this before
(don´t trust your eyes and just listen to your heart)
So tell me why things are not the way they seem?
Oh I must go…
Into the labyrinth - to save me from myself
Into the labyrinth – to find my liberty
Now I´m lost, now I´m here trying to break free from my dreams
There´s a voice telling me I must go… Into the labyrinth
Sometimes I wanna be somebody else
Sometimes I wish that I could be free from this pain
No matter how hard I try
I wish I had a reason to stay alive
[Solos: Roderich de la Cruz/ Siaska Di Borja]
[Lyrics: Siaska Di Borja, music: Tales Of Pain]
Somewhere in this world
Wherever you go wherever you are
You`ll always be a slave
Future now has come
Whatever you want, whatever you do
You`ll never be free
Ain`t it fun to be a victim of our ancient times
It`s so easy now turn back and then just say goodbye
In the darkness you stand alone, don`t leave if you don`t know
The way to reach the light and run away
We`re looking for a treasure
We`re in the land of angels
Seven ages of terror keep us in fear
We can go on forever
Saying the same old prayers
We`ll change our destiny, we`ll fight with our pride…
[Solos: Roderich de la Cruz/ Siaska Di Borja]
Where are you now?
Who do you think you are?
You took our hearts and our souls just to keep us in fear
But now, we have to change our life line…
[Lyrics: Siaska Di Borja, music: Tales Of Pain]
Time has come, there´s no return
You can see it around this world
Day after day we are falling down
Awakening the fury of the seas
You can feel the end is near
Night after night, the stars don´t shine anymore
Lies are all that I can hear
Promises that break our dreams
Time to resist, time to live
If you can say that this is life
You´ll never be the only one
´cause everybody knows where the problem is
Devastations, detonations
I´m alone in this world
Revelations, constellations
I just want to know the truth
(with fire) we´ll pay all our sins
(with fire) this earth will be cleaned
(no pain) now it´s time to believe
(no pain) no pain, no pain, no more fears
[Solos: Siaska/Roderich/Siaska/Roderich/Siaska/Roderich/Siaska/Roderich]
[Lyrics and music: Siaska Di Borja]
Don´t try to tell me who really I am
I don´t wanna know, I understand it
I´m not from this world, I’m not from this life
I don´t wanna go with you I try to stand
(now) now open your eyes and try to see what´s going on again
(you) all around it seems so clear but this is not the reality
(get) they paint your world too beautiful so then you turn into a slave
(trapped) how come you trust in their words if everything´s a lie
This century is taking me away
And I´m just a sinner full of dreams
This century is drying our heads
So right now, it´s time to change our lives.
Once again, the same story
Why do you lose your time?
I hear the voices, I hear the sounds
They´re gonna getcha, they got your mind
(now) now, what´s the purpose to keep you sitting watching every day the same
(you) think about it ´cause it seems that you don´t know the reality
(get) there´s a hidden message in everything that you can see
(lost) all that they want is all that they get why don´t you realize?
[Solos: Siaska Di Borja]
[Lyrics: Siaska Di Borja, music: Tales Of Pain]
An evil force from nowhere lands
Nobody knows where it comes from
A lonely soul facing this world
It´s not the same what you see and what it is
With its evil eyes
It can see everything in this world
In the darkness, flying in the sky
In the silence I was waiting
In the shadows, fury of the night
Time for revenge, time for glory
Calling me out a voice deep inside
Is taking me to face my fate
It´s hard to take hard to deny
It´s not the same what I see and what it is
[Solos: Siaska Di Borja/Roderich de la Cruz]
[Lyrics: Siaska Di Borja, music: Tales Of Pain]
Pressure, I can´t take this temptation
Can´t take this desolation
You know what I am trying to say
Sometimes you need to born again ´cause
You are living like a living dead
And now you are trying to run away
Far away, from your fears
Take me to the line
Between heaven and hell
Take a look around this world
Save me, the wreckage of my past is
Destroying all my memories
And I don´t know what´s gonna be
Now tell me if you know who you really are
´cause I don´t really know who I am
And now I´m trying to runaway
Far away, from my fears
Through the looking glass
[Solos: Siaska Di Borja/Roderich de la Cruz]
[Lyrics and music: Siaska Di Borja]
I feel so tired to think
What I want and what I need
My desire is to find out
My reason to live
It doesn´t matter
How far I have to go
If at the end
I´ll be able to see the light
Now, I´m ready to face myself
Now, I´m ready to face my fate
Lost in a dream, I don´t know
If one day I’ll wake up
Time to live,
Bring me back my forces to survive
I need to feel me alive again
I can´t fight this feeling no more
I need to be alone ´cause
I don´t know if I’ll be able to share my life
[Lyrics: Siaska Di Borja, music: Tales Of Pain]
A thousand years of slavery
(freedom is calling)
I have to choose my destiny
(fighting to reach it)
Feelings inside my mind
(visions of pleasure)
Pain running through my veins
(visions of hate)
Oooooh visions of hate
I don`t want to escape, I need to feel the power
Looking for the chance to show all I can do
All my senses are ready to start
Now open fire, spread your wings burning with desire
Open your mind you have to learn
Don`t look back, don`t hesitate there`s no way out of here
The quest for all your answers now has an end….
Another rainy night my mind is planning the revenge
Dangerous desire time to kill our enemies
[Brabbs / Brabbs / Ward]
Wakey, wakey...
Hated you for far too long, you're just so damn polite
You've been screaming , shouting all night long
That you we've gotta get wrecked tonight...
I don't know when to stop... I just can't get enough...Shellshock!
It's getting late in the evening, I can't wait to turn the lights out...
Come down from the ceiling, don't stop just burn me out...
I don't know when to stop, I just can't get enough...Shellshock!
Some of the things you do... I just don't understand
But those strange things that you do... must mean I'm going mad
I don't know when to stop... I just can't get enough...Shellshock!
Those strange things that you give to me you give me...Shellshock!
[Brabbs / Brabbs / Ward]
All I got for Christmas... was a loaded gun,
That's alright if you wanna shoot someone, but I've only got one bullet...
I'm bored of this, and tired of that, I got to find someone I can shoot at...
I ain't got the guts to do it, she's ugly, stupid, drunk and almost blind,
I don't think that she would really mind, if I described her as unfit for mankind,
Struck by lightning , she's up there from midnight to dawn, waiting for a storm,
Struck by lightning, she's up there from midnight to dawn, waiting for a storm,,
There ain't nothing to it, I can hear her through the ceiling,
I can hear the neighbors cheering, they must have put her up to it,
She's ugly, she's stupid, drunk and almost blind,
I don't think that she would really mind, if I described her as unfit for mankind,
Struck by lightning, she's up there from midnight to dawn waiting for a storm,
Struck by lightning, she's up there from midnight to dawn waiting for a storm,
All I got for Christmas... was a loaded gun,
That's alright if you wanna shoot someone, but I've only got one bullet,
I'm bored of this and tired of that, I got to find someone I can shoot at,
I ain't got the guts to do it, she's ugly, stupid, drunk and almost blind,
I don't think that she would really mind, if I described her as unfit for mankind,
Struck by lightning , she's up there from midnight to dawn, waiting for a storm,
Struck by lightning, she's up there from midnight to dawn, waiting for a storm.
[Brabbs / Brabbs / Ward]
Yeah!!! Roll me over and let me see I wanna watch them suffer all these people lookin' down at me
It really make me shudder, they wont explain how their face doesn't look quite the same
Just who is to blame? We'll be hiding just before they take aim
Run Like Hell, they're comin' at me again Run Like Hell. They're lookin' at me again Run Like Hell
Be a hero, you romantic fool. What makes you so special?
Show off your medal you brought back from school a worthless piece of metal
They wont explain how their face doesn't look quite the same
Just who is to blame? We'll be hiding just before they take aim
Run Like Hell, they're comin' at me again Run Like Hell. They're lookin' at me again Run Like Hell
Run Run Run Run Run Run
Cross the boarder to the land of the free you still think it's clever? to let them keep on torturing me
I just hope I never. See you alone When you're walkin' the streets on your own, your own
Just leave me alone You'll be dead long before you get home
Run Like Hell, they're comin' at me again Run Like Hell. They're lookin' at me again Run Like Hell
Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Like Hell Run Run Run Run Run Run
[Brabbs / Brabbs / Ward]
Blood, Guts and Beer...I got a friend real close to me
With the biggest plane you've ever seen and he likes to use it quite a lot
Just look around and you will see why he isn't scared to me
Just tell him when to stop. What's inside me? Blood, Guts and Beer
If you wonder why he don't look pleased he just caught that new disease
Said "she's coming back to me" but now she's not Well she finally says to me
Well we'll just have to see how long it takes for skin to rot
What's inside me? Blood, Guts and Beer, Blood, Guts and Beer, Blood, Guts and Beer
When he broke down in tears I just couldn't believe my ears I could've used a mirage
I gotta get out, you gotta get out...all right I gotta get out, you gotta get out...tonight
What's inside me? Blood, Guts and Beer, Blood, Guts and Beer, Blood, Guts and Beer
What's inside me? Blood, Guts and Beer, Blood, Guts and Beer, Blood, Guts and Beer
[Brabbs / Brabbs / Ward]
Love is like dragging your balls across barbed wire
She rehearses every day from a hang glider she had a wrestling bout
With a trope of local sea scouts got them all in a pool of mud
All the time wearing boxing gloves you can hear them crying from the third floor above
That's what dreams are made of...
She wears pit boots, woodbines and loves being dirty
Her bank manager plays dog says wood and don't hurt me
You've seen her magazines how the hell does she keep her teeth clean
Doing something that's loosely termed love all the time wearing boxing gloves
She's got the cheek to say she's on a mission from God
That's what dreams are made of...

I can really safely say I'm glad you're still alive,
One thing they can't take away is your will to survive,
I don't, I won't believe it, I don't, I won't believe it,
They say I could not be found, this man is better off dead,
They want to turn your head around, turn your head around, turn your head around, turn your head around,
How can they leave you lying there hiding from the light,
They don't know and they couldn't care they'll be dead by tonight,
I don't, I won't believe it, I don't, I won't believe it,
They say I could not be found, this man is better off dead,
They want to turn your head around,
Turn your head around, turn your head around, turn your head around,
Someone's made a big mistake smiling through the tears,
Just how long will this thing take, I'll be, I'll be coming still,
I don't, I won't believe it, I don't, I won't believe it,
They say I could not be found, this man is better off dead, they want to turn your head around,
Turn your head around, turn your head around, turn your head around.

Yeah It's breaking out all over the world and like flies they're dropping
Invading here would be absurd but once they start there's no stopping
There's no use holding your head in your hands it won't go away
Soon you'll wake up and you'll be a man that's what the handbook says these are your orders, you must obey
Heavy Artillery, Heavy Artillery, Heavy Artillery
Too bad, too bad they got what they wanted without even trying
I'm so glad, so glad the signals got busted without someone dying
There's no use holding your head in your hands it won't go away
Soon you'll wake up and you'll be a man that's what the handbook says, these are your orders, you must obey
It's breaking out all over the world and like flies they're dropping
Invading here would be absurd but once they start there's no stopping
There's no use holding your head in your hands it won't go away
Soon you'll wake up and you'll be a man that's what the handbook says these are your orders, you must obey

I'm putting my heart and soul into a song and I know that it won't belong
A sound real clever, to numb someone to listen up to what I've done
I tried and tried but it's still the same it's still the illusion, the same old game
No matter what I do, it still comes back to you
Do you think I'm stupid or what? Last night someone broke my heart and it kicked me in the guts
Who needs love songs? Who needs love songs? Who needs love songs? I do!
I'm putting my heart and soul into a song and I know that it wont belong
A sound real clever, to numb someone to listen up to what I've done
I tried and tried but it's still the same it's still the illusion, the same old game
No matter what I do, it still comes back to you
Do you think I'm stupid or what?
Last night someone broke my heart and it put me in the ruts
Who needs love songs? Who needs love songs? Who needs love songs? Who needs love songs?
Who needs love songs? Who needs love songs? I do!

They come out of the woodwork, every time that we're around,
When we play some crumbling ruin, they help us to bring it down,
They're the ones with their hands up, the ones that never let us go,
They'd rather sell their mothers, than miss the gig in Glasgow.
They'll be there Shane, Mick and Flash out there somewhere,
They'll be there Shane, Mick and Flash out there somewhere, where are the Filth Hounds.
They do all the hard work for us, all we do is stand up here,
They know all the words and every chorus, shout them out loud clear,
Out there somewhere, are some people we'll soon get to know,
Some more people who'll sell their mothers, than miss the gig in Glasgow.
They'll be there Shane, Mick and Flash out there somewhere,
They'll be there Shane, Mick and Flash out there somewhere, where are the Filth Hounds,
Where are the Filth Hounds, Where are the Filth Hounds...

Why does everybody laugh? They just won't understand
When she walks down the street why they're tearing apart a poor broken heart
She's the nicest woman you could meet, she don't know what he's supposed to be fighting for
She don't know that it's the last thing he'll say to this world
He fell in love with a stormtrooper, He fell in love with a stormtrooper,
He fell in love with a stormtrooper, He fell in love with a stormtrooper
He's always spewing his guts out, he knows it won't stop. He always gets the bottle but not the last drop
He gets out of the sun and the enemy lines but no one knows what he does between the landmines
He don't know what he's supposed to be fighting for
He don't know that it's the last thing he'll say to this world you but you
He fell in love with a stormtrooper, He fell in love with a stormtrooper,
He fell in love with a stormtrooper, He fell in love with a stormtrooper... Yes he did, yes he did
Why does everybody laugh? They just won't understand
When she walks down the street why they're tearing apart a poor broken heart
She's the nicest woman you could meet, she don't know what he's supposed to be fighting for
She don't know that it's the last thing he'll say to this world
He fell in love with a stormtrooper, He fell in love with a stormtrooper,
He fell in love with a stormtrooper, He fell in love with a stormtrooper

Hey! What's going on in your mind? Hey! Why are you so snide?
You are going way past the limit, you're driving your coffin so smile and get in it
Where did I get all this bad luck from, did I get so close so that I get stung
Wouldn't even give the time of day, never listens to a word I say
Somebody has prepared to pay at last
I'm walking barefoot over glass, I'm walking barefoot over glass, I'm walking barefoot over glass
Hey! Are you drunk or just blind. Hey! Don't you think it's about time
You found a way how to kick it, it's my name that you're dropping so don't forget it
Where did I get all this bad luck from, did I get so close so that I get stung
Wouldn't even give the time of day, never listens to a word I say
Somebody has prepared to pay at last
I'm walking barefoot over glass, I'm walking barefoot over glass, I'm walking barefoot over glass
Hey! It was an uphill climb. Hey! I just caught you in time
You are my number one critic, if you say that again I'll tell where to stick it
Where did I get all this bad luck from, did I get so close so that I get stung
Wouldn't even give the time of day, never listens to a word I say
Somebody has prepared to pay at last
I'm walking barefoot over glass, I'm walking barefoot over glass, I'm walking barefoot over glass

There's one type of person, that I love to hate, there's one in here, hangin' round some jailbait
Just wait for an hour, the pleb will demonstrate the girls he gets are ones that inflate
She might need a little persuading, to tell you how much it's worth
There's a cavity, you are invading it's the value, not the pride that hurts
Oh yeah all I got for people that are just like you is pure hatered
Knock you down sideways, you won't feel a thing
Her brother thinks he's still inside a big ring, so that's what your man says, so put him in a sling
So any marriage thoughts are just an inkling
The last time, was really amazing
There's no way that I would die of thirst
It's not the real reason I'm straining
It's the voice not the head that hurts
Oh Yeah all I got for people that are bred like you is pure hatered
So what's the attraction of wasting all your life
With a girl your mother said would be a good wife
So stuff all the flowers, the tassles and the like
Don't give up your job without a good fight
It's not just a bed you're making, you're soon to wear maternal skirts
It's not your parents sheets you are staining, I bet your first time really hurt
[Brabbs / Brabbs / Ward]
Many plans that I've had have been thrown out the window, hopes and dreams
And devious schemes have ended bad well you know
How it is and the way I live are secrets closely guarded
Any chances of being romantic are slim and soon discarded
Why should I sleep within its opening time it seems like I've been here all my life
I don't know what it is but it's in her blood
It's when I get home is when she starts up
Biting and scratching is all she does biting and scratching when making love
Biting and scratching there's no use saying you're tired
Biting and scratching would you call me a liar?
My first love is thinking 'bout just how far can I go
With the ins and outs and where abouts it just gets right up her nose
What is next and I suspect she don't know what she started
Before you know it she'll go and blow in the land of the dear departed
[Brabbs / Brabbs / Ward]
All my life I've been breaking hearts that's what they're for
I don't know what you done to my head but hell it's sore
Why should I wear a hat you must've discovered that
I'm back in the jun again the jun again some came running
Do I have to go back to stars and put your parts in store
Smelling like an a la carte dancing on the floor
See men wearing hats you must've discovered that
I'm back in the jun again the jun again some came running
[Brabbs / Brabbs / Ward]
[Instrumental]
[Brabbs / Brabbs / Ward]
I want to find a woman who smiles when she swallows I want to find a lover
That dives in the shadows I always have to stop
So I never see what follows how can you shoot a gun
When you can't get the ammo we could have the time of our lives
We could stay awake all night her open gusset tights are tied together
Used leather, hanging loose will she take a bribe
To relieve all my sorrows I'll need a sherpa guide
Her insides are so hollow her slut designer jeans
Take hours to unravel she finds it hard to talk with her mouth full of gravel
[A. Osmond / W. Osmond / M. Osmond]
There's a message floatin' in the air
Comes from, crazy horses ridin' everywhere
It's a warning, it's in every tongue
Gotta stop them crazy horses on the run
What a show, there they go smokin' up the sky, yeah
Crazy horses all got riders, and they're you and I
Crazy horses , crazy horses, crazy horses
Never stop and they never die
They just keep on puffin' how they multiply
Crazy horses, will they never halt?
If they keep on movin' then it's all our fault
So take a good look around,
See what they've done, see what they've done...
They've done, they've done, they've done, they've done...
Crazy horses, crazy horses, crazy horses...
[Brabbs / Brabbs / Ward]
I'm looking out for something, but I don't know what
It's always cold when I'm hangin' out and I'm in when it's hot
Why do I have to do this? A fool to myself
Resistance will be useless that's why you need some help
You better wait your turn I guess you'll never learn you mother fucker
I show you what I mean, I blow a can of gasoline,
Only for a laugh! I'm gonna set your back on fire I'm gonna make you burn
I find it so disgusting, and that's a fact You got where you are from standing up
and lying on your back You said I'd be the first one
I really was the twelfth and I wouldn't go back to your cozy flat cause I value my good health
You better wait your turn I guess you'll never learn you mother fucker
I show you what I mean, I blow a can of gasoline,
Only for a laugh! I'm gonna set your back on fire I'm gonna make you burn
I'm looking out for something, but I don't know what
It's always cold when I'm hangin' out and I'm in when it's hot
Why do I have to do this? A fool to myself
Resistance will be useless that's why you need some help
You better wait your turn I guess you'll never learn you mother fucker
I show you what I mean, I blow a can of gasoline,
Only for a laugh! I'm gonna set your back on fire I'm gonna make you burn

Red skulls running riot over the hill
And cap n' bulky's out there fighting with them still
The furher wants our heroes dead or alive the SS keep them running, running out of time
Ignoring our warning of that booby trapped plane that man is no evil, that man is insane
Red skull rock the dance of the red skull
Of course they're keep on fighting they'll fight till their last
They need all the help they can get and they need it fast
Hear the madman laughing, with his iron cross will watch the way his eyes light up when it's time to kill
[Repeat Chorus]
The captain is living but frozen in ice and bulky's not forgotten for his brave young life
But they're hard, too hard to find
[Brabbs / Brabbs / Ward]
Hold on to your toupees!
The end is coming closer now every word is said in spite
They ain't getting any younger they're too old to live by the knife
Can't you see it in their eyes can't you see it in their eyes
Their sick and tired of waiting now the hunters on the attack
Before they started fighting they knew damn well, they're not coming back
Can't you see it in their eyes can't you see it in their eyes
Don't believe it, look behind get your arse out of there, run for your life
Feel the power of the hunter...
So many of them wasted they'll never know what war's about
Those we loved, now are hated now all hell is breaking out
Can't you see it in their eyes can't you see it in their eyes
Don't believe it, look behind get your arse out of there, run for your life
Feel the power of the hunter...
And now that's over we'll never know how many died
At the tomb of the unknown soldier I hope the cowards are satisfied
Can't you see it in their eyes can't you see it in their eyes
Don't believe it, look behind get your arse out of there, run for your life
Feel the power of the hunter...
All right... There they stand our fine leaders all,
While they're together... Has any one thought to talk...
There's no plan. Crisis? Not at all their own existence
Relies on a horse to stalk...
While they're backbiting an air strike, like lightning engage!
There's been no peace sittings today... They're still fighting... 'Cause we're Still at War,
Still at War, still fighting, but what are they fighting for
Uncle Sam, this one's too close to call, you're under pressure,
From Israel's wailing wall, insane sad man
Your flag's about to fall the world is indifferent
To your pleas for food for oil hatred inciting
A no-fly zone sitting... engage! It's too late the bombs are away...They're still fighting...
Cause we're, Still at War... Still at War. Still fighting, but what are they fighting for?
Still At War... Still At War... Let it be so... They're still fighting,
'Cause we're, Still At War. Still At War, still fighting,
But what are they fighting for? [Repeat] Still At War... Still At War...
Goin' down now... I should've known,
From the start, when I met her, at Selhurst Park
So she could get her evil way, she had me drinking night and day
And then we fucked, I lost my tether
I was blown apart she stole my hard drive
And then my heart I didn't need to be stuck like glue,
In a relationship, with a girl like you...
Nineteen with life to go, there was no trick she didn't know, she has a mole
Where my tongue rests where? You'll have to guess
That girl's name is death, that girl's name is death
It lasted a thousand days, it just left me confused & dazed
When push come to shove little old Alge
Wasn't good enough...Nineteen with life to go...
There was no trick she didn't know...
Blonde hair perfect face... What she needs is a pearl necklace...
One regret, I have to this day that I didn't give her "A"
She has a mole where my tongue rests, where?
You'll have to guess... that girls name is death...
Werrrrrrroooo goin down now... Nineteen with life to go...
...That girl's name is death...
Yo! A protest march is guarded, on each side
By London's finest Metropolitan pride
There won't be trouble, batons left behind...
The tapes are runnin'... A marcher thinks that now is the time...
To make a statement, while still in her prime
She sets her clothes alight, several times...
The tapes are runnin', the tapes are runnin', the tapes are runnin', the tapes are runnin'
In real time... Light the fire, watch'em burn. Light the fire, watch'em burn, watch'em burn
The lens man stands, behind the Police line...
Taking shots that he will soon decide...
What will make the headlines at nine
The tapes are runnin', the tapes are runnin', the tapes are runnin', the tapes are runnin'...
In real time... Light the Fire, watch'em burn, light the Fire, watch'em burn
Watch'em burn, watch'em burn, watch'em burn, Oh modulate,
Would you Clifford, light the fire... Light the fire, watch'em burn, light the fire, watch'em burn
Watch'em burn, watch'em burn. Watch'em burn, watch'em burn. Hell, watch'em burn
Yeah, Yeah I tend to see things, as they really are...
Right up close, near and far emotional cripple and Lord I bare the scars...
That's me standing at the bar from the age of eighteen, to the age of twenty-one...
I was fired up, having fun down at the "speak", chasing slammers on the run...
And getting high, from a shotgun I walked in, eyes open wide it felt good inside
Was I scared? I was petrified... But I won't stop, 'til I'm certified...
I've got the world, in the palm of my hand...The world awaits my every command...
For the last six years I have lived with pain...In my side, in my brain
It's no matter, I'd still be the same...Heading out on the road again
I walked in, eyes open wide... It felt good inside, was I scared? I was petrified...
But I won't stop 'til I'm certified, I've got the world in the palm of my hand...
I've got the world in the palm of my hand...
Tornado's a coming mother nature's main event storm chasers running
To the scene of the accident a car lies broken at the side of the road
Someone trapped inside but who will know a gas line's broke, it's on fire
It will explode debris falls from the sky the sheer force, the sheer power
It mystifies we all have a time to die but it's time to say goodbye...
And then we heard the thunder so loud it shook the ground
And then we heard the thunder such an awesome sound
The wreck is still burning Detroit metal, twisted and bent
There's no point returning as those inside are heaven sent
We just stand and watch and cry with remorse, we cower
Under dangerous skies we all have a time to die but it's time to say goodbye...
And then we heard the thunder so loud it shook the ground
And then we heard the thunder such an awesome sound
See the young man see he's crying see his first born, lay in his arms dying
Where a child once stood was where she always would
See his young wife, see she's crying see her first born, lay in his arms dying
If she only stood where her child always would
A young life would not know the river ice would not hold
A young life would not know the river freezes so cold
In the last hours before dawn in the last hours before dawn
In the last hours, they will mourn in the last hours before dawn
See the flowers, see the coffin see that her life will not be forgotten
If they only could, you know they'd turn back the clock for good
A young life would not know the river ice would not hold
A young life would not know the river freezes so cold.
Now they're all together. There is no one in disguise, now they're all together.
They can see each other's eyes now they're all together...
They can spin a web of lies now they're all together...They can ruin someone's life
A nations hero is exposed... But do we really care our hero's story will be told
But do we really care our hero's book will soon be sold...But do we really care
Our hero's album has gone gold... But, do we really care
A conspiracy of hate, the misery they create
Now in the star chamber...Their next victim is in line now in the star chamber.
Fit the suspect to the crime now in the star chamber...Throw the dice they'll win...
You'll lose now in the star chamber...
All aboard the ship of fools a nations hero is exposed
But, do we really care our hero's story will be told... But do we really care
Our hero's book will soon be sold... But do we really care
Our hero's album, has gone gold...But do we really care
A conspiracy of hate the misery they create
A conspiracy of hate the misery they create
A conspiracy of hate you bastards...A nations hero etc...
A conspiracy of hate the misery they create a conspiracy of hate
The misery they create a conspiracy of hate...
Hell, yeah...Going back to Vietnam again, searching for ghosts and old news
I'm standing in the Saigon rain wonderin' which lens that I used
Oh yeah, what can you tell from a photograph? Oh yeah, how do you know
When to cry or laugh? Ho Chi Minh City is now it's name
Pot holed battered abused a waste of life for little gain
An airfield overgrown and disused
Oh yeah, what can you tell from a photograph? Oh yeah, how do you know when to cry or laugh?
When the hunter becomes the hunted, when the hunter becomes the hunted
Ah yeah... Hell yeah... Aaaaaaah...
The camera's silent it waits in vain focused and ready to use
This limbless child does have a name
Agent orange? I thought that you knew
Oh yeah, what can you tell from a photograph? Oh yeah, how do you know when to cry or laugh?
When the hunter becomes the hunted, when the hunter becomes the hunted
Ah Yeah...Ah Yeah... When the hunter becomes the hunted
Ah Yeah...
Ten long years of being off the tracks
We return a full on attack well, well, well
The tour bus Parked right out the back
The parking lot at Offenbach we met some friends there
Manfred and Gotz...They're out there, somewhere Manfred and Gotz...
They're out there, somewhere Cerberus...
Heralds the return Cerberus... Heralds the return Cerberus-Heralds the return... Of the filth hounds
We disembark for a night time raid Deutschland roars as we hit the stage...
Man, you should've been there Manfred and Gotz...
They're out there, somewhere Manfred and Gotz....
They're out there somewhere Cerberus...
Heralds the return Cerberus... Heralds the return Cerberus... Heralds the return... Of the filth hounds
M.T.W. Hammer on!!! Cerberus... Heralds The Return Cerberus...Heralds The Return Cerberus...
Yeah, yeah, just one man is all it takes...To turn fear... into race hale
This one man had chose the Jew to destroy away from view
Afraid to hide afraid to fight Gestapo raid in the night
One whole nation on the run from the jack boot and the gun...
They've not forgotten the Fuhrer's master plan
Juden Verbotten in Deutschland
They've not forgotten the hatred shown to man
Juden Verbotten... Understand... The blood's still on their hands
Pray for the fallen and the brave...And hope their souls will be saved
A Holocaust, no other name... Millions lie in unmarked graves...
They've not forgotten...
The blood's still on their hands
The survivors one's he spared they're still frightened
They're still scared live a nightmare all their lives... Peace will come, when they die...
They've not forgotten, the Fuhrer's master plan...
A bottom line decision you're in the field of vision a cut means an incision somewhere...
We're not in your division a lie, a politician you get what you are given so there...
There's nothing to see here a life without religion a crash without collision
A laugh without derision nowhere, a sense of style is driven
Four miles are never ridden, to a good home a kitten I don't care
Without love you are one without God you're no-one not allowed to have any fun
The fear inside...Right here inside...The fear inside...Right here, inside
The underneath is hidden the hand that feeds is bitten an ancient aunt, bedridden
Don't stare, forgive the unforgiven know every word that's written
The naked eye that's smitten do I care? Without love you are one
Without God you're no one not allowed to have any fun
The fear inside...Right here inside...The fear inside...Right here inside
Oh shoo shoo. The fear inside... Right here inside
A how, how, how, how
[Bonus Track]
It's my life and I have made a decision it's Friday night and I'm heading right for oblivion
It won't take me long to find my relief by closing time, I'll be fucked up beyond belief
Barman, would you help me up again, when I fall a whole weeks wages pissed up the wall
Would you like to help me with my disease I'll drink you under the table on your feet or your knees
If you need a cure you're in trouble I sure need a cure give me a double
I'm really not interested in your opinion you boring harrumph get out, goodbye, good riddance
Barman, would you help me up again, when I fall a whole weeks wages pissed up the wall
Would you like to help me with my disease I'll drink you under the table on your feet or your knees
If you need a cure you're in trouble I sure need a cure I'm C-ing Dub-all
Barman, would you help me up again, when I fall a whole weeks wages pissed up the wall
Would you like to help me with my disease I'll drink you under the table on your feet or your knees
Bar's open!!!!!!
If you need a cure you're in trouble I sure need a cure give me a double
If you need a cure you're in trouble I sure need a cure I'm C-ing Dub-all
I am now a free man and I just don’t know what to do with myself.
Am I really ready to take on this effort.
I can’t take a hint.
Take me from this depression.
You are the one to do it.
I can’t take a hint.
How could a manufactured rose harness a thorn of metal.
You did not let one drop of blood fall onto the ground.
Or transfer onto our expensive and illustrious.
Clothing that we donned for the evening.
You did not know the precious commodity.
You wear that scar as a keepsake to when we weren’t stereotyped.
That one time you did not know the precious commodity.
You make me wish that I didn’t think that dancing was such a stupid ritual.
You make me wish I was young again.
So the small things are worth more.
A piece of you was left in that photo booth.
Black and white can’t describe the details.
People ask you “where’d you get that”
I hate to break it to you.
But your crisis has come to an end.
Whether you like it or not.
“I’m saving every bullet for your fucking face” Here we go again.
And these things always seem to happen.
I hope you remember me as I remember you as dead.
Fuck the hatchet.
Bury the body.
Fuck the hatchet.
Bury you.
I never thought that I would want to die alone.
But I have kind of been forced into that sentiment.
I wish that I could remember what set me off so I could justify this overreaction in every sense of the word.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
And desperate measures call selfish acts of stupidity.
Those are the types of things that will lead to the attachment.
Of the one that would like to forget I have done something that I have come to truly regret.
You play the headstrings as if they were a harp.
Don’t you tell me any different.
So cut the drama.
We’ll shed no tears for you.
You are nothing in the grand scheme of things.
Catch and release.
But I want to take you down to where the greatest beasts get butterflies.
I think you should go back to where you came from.
You’re fucking things up.
You’re not wanted here.
You are losing your appeal just as fast as rumors fly.
Lick your lips for me one last time.
So I can see the reflection of horror on your face.
The dying whim and other words deemed poetic.
Everyone has their own path to follow.
But their tracks are on my back.
I’ve been crying sunscreen for so long.
So then when you bring the sunshine you can’t see my tears.
How can you say that you will let this fly forever? When you don’t know how long that is.
Trying to understand what’s incoherent will only bring more pain than it’s worth.
And I don’t know how long to go on like this.
Seeing through an insomniac’s perspective.
Brings a bunch of new points of view.
Today I watched the sun rise on grey and clouded skies.
I’ve been crying these tears for so long.
Breath through your mouth as not to asphyxiate.
Require assistance.
Do you require assistance or would you prefer if I demonstrated for you.
Inhale - Exhale.
That’s all there is to this process.
I was unfortunate enough to see you in my rearview mirror.
You made a bad thing worse when I tried to make a worse thing better.
I told you that you would never, ever come and get that from me.
I have never fought for anything in my whole life.
So what makes you think that I’ll go and start with you.
Grinding his fingers off.
Grinding his fingers away.
Turn that hat around so you can shove your face into your pillow and cry out all your worries.
Cry into it.
But tears don’t count if they don’t run red.
So many years have been washed down the drain.
And dreams don’t count if they don’t come true.
This friendship has come to an end.
I’m sick of you talking all your shit.
This friendship has come to an end.
Ideals just don’t matter if they were never there.
What were you thinking? Where was your head at? What will you do with all that ink? What will you do with your name? Friends and family will ask - does he even have a name?
If you ever want to come in contact again I’ll have my people contact yours.
But it seems that your people have already come in contact with mine.
Your people, my people.
Betrayal (your) Stereotypical - oh so, derivative - over poetic words.
Fail to individualize your work from the others who happen to be in the same mind set.
I could be just like every other band and try to burn my bridges down.
But those bridges are still all connected to me.
I did not know that you looked at them like that.
Bridges aren’t enough.
I’ll burn your fucking house down.
Born with nothing
And that was most of us
Raised in unemployment lines
Grew inside domestic Crimes
Always against the odds
One with the underdogs
Stepped on since day one
Taught to accept defeat
Expectations of a failure
Always told I was nothing
Always against the odds
One with the underdogs
We are the underdogs
Had to scratch and fight
Just to stay on my feet
With a heart made of steel
I smashed through everything
Always against the odds
One with the underdogs
No one hears what - what you say
No one is there - there for you
But I've got music and I've got friends
Both always by my side
Convictions instilled in me
This is what keeps me alive
You don't know me
Don't know any of us
Don't know what this means
Keep your mouth shut
Try and try - to tear me down
Run and run - run your mouth
But it's you who's lost
In social ills, lust and greeds
This is for the outcasts that never fit
This is all that we need
I don't care what you think of me
I don't hear what you say
You never had it, you never will
Keep your mouth shut and worry about yourself
Keep your mouth shut
I can't believe you sunk this low, so low
You pushed too hard and lost control
Now death is reaching for your hand
and when theres nothing left
you start reaching back
Shoveling shit up your nose
Needle to your arm
Less than zero
The bottle calls
You run to it
and I need it too
anything to forget
Self destruct
You're killing yourself
You gotta fight
Pick yourself back up
And man I've been there too
Numbing my broken dreams
and the love that I've killed
You're killing yourself
You gotta fight or you will
Self destruct
I'm scared of me
I'm scared of you
because we will
Self destruct
Are we alive
Is death by my side
I hear the sirens, see the flashing lights
Every step I take, death is by my side
Watch us wither, burnt at both ends
Bury your hopes, and hold your breath
Are we alive
Is death by my side
Work your fingers to the bone
Die with nothing, die alone
You point the gun at me
I point it at you
Born to expire
And there's nothing we can do
Are we alive
Is death by my side
Are we alive
Is there anything left - anything left
Anything left inside
Addiction, disease
The fear of war it spreads
This world's a nightmare
I'm left for dead
Everything I loved left me
Everything I cared for died or changed
I've fallen, I failed
And I lost everything I fought to gain
Over - Overcome
Everytime you spit in my face
Over - Overcome
Add more weight! I won't break
Over - Overcome
Won't allow myself to be beat
Overcome, Overcome, rise back up
Always trouble surrounding me
But I've learned from past mistakes
I've seen true hate, felt real pain
Still there's nothing that can stop me
Break me down
I will rise back up
I'll overcome
Best friends become strangers
True love it turns to hatred
Nothing you can do to me
Still something deep inside
Tells me to be free
Don't forget I know where you come from
I watched it all, your every change
From nothing to something so fast
You nerve had a chance to learn a thing
And there's so many just like you
And it's always the same
Forever ends before it began
And now it's yourself that you hate
Spit my rage
In your face
Spit my rage
And those so quick to judge
With a mouthful of shit you feed to everyone
Lost in contradiction
Now it's yourself you can't live with
Spit my rage
In your face
Spit my rage
Cut back down to size
Lost in your own lies
I'll spit - spit my fucking rage
In your face
Spit my rage
In your face
Attention thats your only friend
Every move you make, you want it seen by them
And you speak so loud, so we know what you're about
Now all eyes are on you, still you never made a sound
No one cares
About all the shit you do
No one cares
You look like a fool
Always know the right ones
Always front and center, wasting space
Throwing your opinions, drawing them in
Making sure that we see your face
No one cares what you do
No one cares about you
Too long we let this fall apart
Too long we believed in those with no heart
Too long fake fools they had their say
No more will you disgrace my everything
Not this time
No more
Not this time
Too long values we let the blend and fade
Too long our truths they've gone so astray
Too long I believed you and I were one in the same
No more will you deface my only name
This time is my time
This time is our time
Those who struggle
The ones with sight
Come from the heart and sacrifice
We are so alive
This is our time
Lost in your
Simple mind - not me
Follow blind - not me
Fall in line - not me
Quick to change - not me
Know everything- not me
Caught in between - not me
Now the truth it crushes down,
Crushes down on you
Bend to belong - not me
Never wrong - not me
Here then gone - not me
False claims - not me
Two-faced - not me
First to fade - not me
Crushed by the truth
You're so fucking weak
And you're so fucking fake
And now the truth it crushes down
And slaps you in the face
Fuck Everything and everybody,
Hypocrites and all the fakes,
Leaches and the followers,
Best to stay out of my way,
Out of my face,
Out of my way,
So many times you crossed my path,
With clenched fists I made my way,
Force fed so many lies,
You can't get ahold of me
Out of my face, out of my way,
Fuck everything you believe,
Fuck what you say
So many rats in my face,
You wont get the best of me,
So many traps set in my way,
You could never break me
This is all that I've got
My only hope - my hope
This is my truth - my truth
Everything I believe
I found in you
All I'll never turn away
from all that you gave
This is one life, you truly saved
This is all that I've got
This is all that I want
This is all that I've got
All I need
And everywhere I go
I find those just like me
The words I speak, what I've been through
They know exactly what I mean
And although we've never met before
You're still part of me
If you were down, I'll be there
To bring you to your feet
This is all that I've got
This is all that I want
This is all that I've got
All I need
In this world full of filth and hate
In you I found my escape
And I'll give back until my last breath
Believe in me, believe in this
This is all I've got
My friends are dying
They're struck down by disease
A family built on lies
Now none of them even know me
Through the crowds I walk
But still I'm left alone
So I'll push on, with all I've got
It's all I've ever known
Don't tell me that I'll be OK
Can't trust in anything
I'll survive, I've got my heart
I'll find my way
For everything I gave
I've got nothing to show
Feeling lost and out of place
is all I've ever known
Don't tell me that I'll be OK
Can't trust in anything
I'll survive, I've got heart
I'll find my way
I'll find my way
Give me the strength
I'll find my way
You think that is all I can take
My way
I'll find my way
So you're gonna tell me what's hardcore
Pass judgement on me and distort my words
I fucking gave my life to this
I talk too much, I contradict myself
I do the same old thing, I'm full of myself
Say what you say, it holds no weight
I'm looking you in the eyes
Keep my enemies in clear sight
No more dead weight, cut it away
The force of vengeance is inside of me
It's all coming back at you
Till my heart stops this lives through me
Tried and true, proven longevity
It's you that cracks with time
I'm looking you in the eyes
Keep my enemies in clear sight
I hope by now you know where this is coming from
Time to shut you down, put you in check
Smash the truth in you face, and send you on your way
I'll take the weight, hold the shame
Inside myself, I'm cut by blame
As the burden falls on me
Down on me
How could they know, the poisoned youth
Victim of the times, never shown truth
And you and me sat back and watched
As the foundation broke
This, this is the end
All, all for revenge
Destroy, rebuild, bomb your words
Our times at hand, I want to watch you burn
I can't ignore it anymore
Go right for you throat
An end to you, those in control
You feed the masses, a mindless clone
No wealth or fame can ever replace
My one true love, my saving grace
This is a call for vengeance
The search for redemption
The truth it speaks louder then bombs
So I confront myself and now I shut you down
This is the end all for revenge
Narrow minded fools
Running in their packs
Nothing but a fistful of hate
Set for the attack
Strike you down
With all my will, all my strength
I crush you down
Can't unite with what I despise
Destroying your alibis
Now it's your turn
Your turn to feel the pain
The first strike, a vicious strike
Forcing you towards the end
Strike now, crush down
Your turn to feel the pain
Strike now, crush down
Your turn to feel the pain
Focused mind
I move in silence desperately
Can't lose myself in all that I see
Grinded by a will that never dies
Gotta break out, can't escape without a fight
Fight so hard just to get by
Confusion tries my peace
Fight so hard just to get by
Survival comes crashing down on me
So many answers I just could not find
So I roll with the lows and the highs
Gotta break out, can't escape without a fight
Hope gives birth to strength
Strength breaks through the loss, the greed
Got to break out, got to move on
Cause what was, will never be
Got to break out
Got to take some pain
Survival crashes in
Down on me
Survival
Comes down on me
Survival
Self raised, self made
Nothing was ever handed to me
I tasted pain, the gutter hugged me
Till I stood up and embraced the flames
Always pushing, always searching
Always crossing the line
Try to hold me back
I swing the hammer of inner strength
Always the hard way
Nothing was never handed to me
Always the hard way
You taught me truth, you gave me strength
I learned everything the hard way
Helpless and crisis
Without them you never know better days
Unsound, self bound
Cause you never had to fight for anything
Can't keep with the changes
I just don't like what I see
Surrounded by all you hypocrites
Nothing here feels right to me
The faceless with so much to say
So sick of words I can't relate
Searched for just a moment of peace
Found out that there's nothing here for me
Just like you
I'm fucking lost
Stick tight to my friends
That's all I need
The underdogs ans outcasts
Next to me
And there's that one
She always pulled me through
Hard in this life
We are thrown into
This is heart of steel
Goes against the grain
Nothing to live for
So nothing's stands in my way
The truth carries me
And I see it in you
Our will to survive
Fights its way through
Everybody's crawling back
And think they should be heard
Gone longer than you were ever
And already ate all of your words
Last of the diehards
For better or for worse
Last of the diehards
You're living proof this is more than words
True agents of change, the living proof
I put all my faith in you
Gave me strength, showed me the way
The blood and the honor
It still remains
Forced to crawl as the failure
Worthless gains they broke me
Fought pain with time and hate
'til my drive crossed my defeat
Hit me with all your strength
So close to defeat
Gotta push, gotta fight
You won't get the best of me
Reactions cut to the kill
Can't make sense of the truth
Determination, my only fuse
Try and take me out the box
I'm the lion and the fox
Test my convictions
They'll run you through
You know where to find me
Different city to blaze
Bangin' out on the late night
Burn that shit up, live to play
Can't let the blacklash touch me
Bottom feeders two faced
Never will I answer to you
I gave life, you gave nothing
Jealous loud mouths
Half truths, don't say my name
Got to hold my fists back
I can't live my life that way
A back you just can't turn
Can't look me in the eye
So little heart in you
I can't believe you're still alive
Straight faced, emotionless
I lie, I cheat, I steal
Reckless nights with my own life living in this filth and sin
Rot my insides with bottles and highs
Gonna get what's coming my way
Hell bound, sink down
Wrath of the heavens cast out
Hell to pay
Some sins don't wash away
I hear them calling me
So I sin to cover up my sins
Lost in the sickness, breathe it in
Moral decay I can't escape
No regrets, no shame but there's hell to pay
I hear them calling me
Some sins don't wash away
I've got hell to pay
Relentless, they're forcing in
Now it's over, now it's over
Under pressure, they drop the hammer again
So much closer, so much closer to me
One step behind, one step behind
I've got to cover my tracks
Mindless, so they call on me
They've got me cornered, got me cornered
Empty, so they steal to breathe
Just get it over, get it over
Don't you ever look my way
And don't you say the words I say
Never will you tread on me
You'll always be one step behind of me
One step, one step behind
Trapped in aggression with vacant stares
All I am turns to emptiness
For myself and the ones I love
All we can do is run
This void keeps calling me
Life's aim brought me to knees
At times survival cuts so deep
Still I won't face defeat
You can't break me
I won't be beat
Smash myself to see if I can still feel
Pain's the only thing that's ever been real
I'm caught in it and I'm sinking fast
But I know that I will last
Forced down, my back against the wall
Try to break me, I'll answer the call
From broken homes and shattered hopes
All the streets are filled with pain
Nothing to live to
The devil sells broken dreams
Rise, fall, crash and I burn
And now I see, hardship, it belongs to me
Living on borrowed time
A minute to pray, and a second to die
Don't get caught between
A man and his enemy
Hardship, it belongs to me
It belongs to me
Now I see myself
Gone at the end of a rope
Damned and unwanted
It's all I know
Face to face with what I must destroy
My own worst enemy crossed out, void
And you think you hate me?
I can take you best
It could never touch
How much I hate myself
Smash through you
Set to explode
I must destroy
I smash through you
Caged inside, I against I
Destined to burn in these desperate times
Buring from the inside out
Bloody foam spews from your mouth
Smell the putrid stench of flesh
As it burns you to your death
Feel the flesh drip from your face
Turing black, vision fades
Eyeballs melt into their sockets
Involuntarily set ablaze
Gutwrenching screams fill the air
The rancid smell of burning hair
Screaming in excruciating pain
Blood boils over, warping veins
Burnt skull collapses onto melting brains
Spontaneous death, up in flames
Twisting and writhing as life burns away
Until nothing is left but charred remains
[lead: D.C.]
[Music and lyrics: C.R.]
After the caskets put into the ground
Loved ones crying walk away
Corpse unknowingly left behind
Other needs for sick human prey
Casket closed as mourners read
Pages from their holy book
Waiting in a meat locker
Morticians meal hangs from a hook
Storing dead carcases to dine upon
Chewing on rotten arms and legs
Brutal desecration of the dead
Hacking bodies until he's fed
Service for a vacant coffin
Corpse is being digested
Chronic hunger for cold flesh
Remains of the dead are molested
[lead: E.C.]
[Music and lyrics: C.R.]
Here I sit surrounded by white
My arms wrapped around my back real tight
What did I do that was so worng that I had to pay
I don't think anyones gonna miss her anyway
I just couldn't take anymore shit
So with a swing of my knife her stomach was split
Putrid bile and guts al over the floor
Couldn't help but laugh at this vision of gore
Severed flesh began to expel blood
The stench of defecation as I cut
Shoved my hand into the gaping slice
As you tried to emit gurgling cries
Intestines on the ground
Guts removed
Disebowel
Twitching....Violently
Dying....In agony
Blood....Comes flowing forth
Eyes....No longer see
[lead: D.C.]
Severed flesh began to expel blood
The stench of defecation as I cut
Shoved my hand into the gaping slice
As you tried to emit gurgling cries
Intestines on the ground
Guts removed
Disebowel
[Music and lyrics: E.C.]
Tightening grip around the neck
Gasping for air that isn't there
Feeling life's source draining away
Slowly slipping to God you pray
Eyes popping out, as the face turns blue
Crushed windpipe, swallowing in blood
Hopeless thoughts, loss of breath
Loss of life, strangled to death
Digging the grave in which you will lie
Buried head deep and left to die
Body paralyzed beneath the sand
Tide comes in...Asphyxiation
Watrlogged corpse, Back from the dead
Rips the eyeballs from his head
Snapping neck, blood pours down
Decapitated body rotting away
[lead: E.C.]
Gasping for air
Gasping for air
[Music and lyrics: C.R.]
Stricken with a horrible disease
Mankind falls victim to doom
Festering plague spreads across the earth
Rotting death...Morbid curse
Skin begins to rot
Deaden and peel away
Bones collapse
From advanced decay
Slow and painful death
No more blood to bleed
No end to the cadevers
Ridden with disease
Faces decomposing
Screaming in pain and despair
Becoming one with the earth
Flesh deteriorates until bones are bare
Skin begins to rot
Deaden and peel away
Bones collapse
From advanced decay
Slow and painful death
No more blood to bleed
No end to the cadevers
Ridden with disease

Visions from the altar
Ripping through your soul
Seeing through the master's eyes
Young flesh the goal
Brutal rampage
Destroy the house of christ
Obey your master
Another victim violently dies
Head torn off
A trophy raised to the sky
Bloody priest
Dies in pain
Stomach chewed open
Lying on the grave
As you bathe in the piss
Your master rains upon your face
Hear the calling from the abyss
Pagan destroyer crushes your race
[lead: E.C.]
Final reward
Bestowed upon you
Look into his eyes
As your head is removed
[Music C.R. & E.C.]
[Lyrics: C.R.]
Hellish noises follow you
The world is closing in you're sensing doom
Footsteps dragging heavily
Not ready to meet eternity
Blind man following close behind
Begging you to spare a dime
But you know he wants you dead
As you shove your fingers into his head
Eyesockets penetrated by your hand
Inncoent blood is spill
But you have stopped his plan
Running fast to escape
The scream of sirens call your name
Bloody corpse left on the street
Police pig vomits uncontrolably
See the old woman from the corner of your eye
Why does she want to make you die?
End it fast with a knife in her gut
Better to spill hers insead of your blood
Hear her gasping as you flee
Impending dread, you will never be free
[lead: D.C.]
[Music and lyrics: C.R.]
Stranded alone on a barren island
No food to be found
Point of desperation
Shocking desicion on how to survive
Now it's time to break out the knife
First inscion the cut is complete
First source of food is one of your feet
Incredible pain as you cauterize the wound
Preparing yourself for a horrible doom
Amputation for your rations
Legs are gone, start new gashes
Half of your fingers are now cut away
To live through another agonizing day
Feasting on the rest of your arm
Next the slice goes across your throat
[lead: D.C.]
[Music and lyrics: C.R.]
Mind snapped thoughts of death
Demented voices in his heaad
Chainsaw victim covered in blood
Severed body left for dead
Bloody killing spree
Brain fried eternally
Psychotic mission of death
Critical madness
Self inflicted pain
Slicing his face to shreds
Brutal blow to the face
Sentenced to death
By a swing of a mace
Blown out brains with a grenade
Hallucinating brain decayed
Violent breakdown
Truth of dare
Cut your flesh to the bone
No hope for a normal life
Insane asylum is your home
[lead: E.C.]
[Music: E.C.] 
[Lyrics: C.R.]
Epidermis punctured
As the deadened blood is drawn
Stiff cadever on the table
Victims of death's spawn
Desicate, deteriorate
Start to decompose
Process of embalment
Through your veins the chemicals flow
No more thoughts inside your head
Your brain is on a tray
Injection of formaldehyde
Organs have decayed
Light of day not to be seen
Again by the deceased
Rigor mortis is your future
Death ignored your pleas
Blood replced by chemicals
No more life is found
Next stop is a wooden box
Rotting underground
[lead: E.C.]
[Lyrics: Chris Reifert]
[Music: Chris Reifert]
Morbid price to pay for a night of fun
A coathanger will get the job done
Piercing the life you let out a cry
Feel the blood run, feel your child die
A bloody pile of discharge flesh
In what you see as you face death
On the ground is the lifeless meat
Stillborn child lays at your feet
In shock from the pain you lay and bleed
Staring at the infant corpse you choke and heave
Death takes hold of your twisted brain
Slowly suffering as you die in pain
A bloody pile of discharge flesh
In what you see as you face death
On the ground is the lifeless meat
Stillborn child lays at your feet
Promised myself only lies
Burnt bridges, bit the hand that feeds
I've got to find my calm
And smash through all the filth inside of me
We come from every corner of the Earth in all ages, shapes, colors, and creeds.
Born into a world we didn't understand, we found a place in the underground that binds us all as one.
When all I see is sickness and all I see is pain.
We never had a chance in this fucking world.
We are the lost, the damned, the shamed.
Broken homes, lost souls.
Abandoned hopes, all time lows, and I know you all feel the same.
We are the lost, the damned the shamed.
We are the lost, the damned, the shamed.
In this world that has nothing for me.
On the outside is where I stay.
Outside, against the grain.
We are the lost, the damned the shamed.
Deny your rules, deny your ways.
Deny your truths, against the grain.
We are the lost, the damned the shamed.
We walk arm and arm; the truth's our shield.
In these days we can't relate.
We found our place beneath your world.
We always go against the grain.
Were the damaged, forgotten, disposed of.
All the filth, all the waste.
We found our place beneath your world.
We always go against the grain.
We are the lost, the damned, we are the shamed.
We found our place beneath your world.
We always go against the grain.
Living an aimless life with a chip on your shoulder and no respect for anything is so easy in the senseless age I don't to live my life that way anymore. I've got to believe there is something more for me.
Strike that hare from inside of you.
Hard tested, hard tempered.
Living like a fool.
Aimless aggression boiling over.
Relentless through and through.
Believe in nothing, trust no one.
Man, I've been there too.
Believe in nothing, trust no one.
Strike that hate from inside you.
Painstaking, short fuse.
The cycle's left its mark on you..
Force fed malice, trace it back.
Even things out before you crash.
Believe from inside of you.
Inside of you.
Can't get to me, I'll take the pain.
I want it all to just fade away.
Strike that hate from inside of you.
Worthless, disgrace.
I want it all to just fade away.
Strike that hate from inside of you.
Relentless through and through.
Living like a fool.
Relentless through and through.
Living your life like a fool.
Living your life like a fool.
Living like a fool.
Believe in nothing, trust no one.
Man I've been there too.
Believe in nothing, trust no one.
Strike that hate from inside of you.
Inside of you.
Being crossed out by those closest to you cuts so deep and causes a pain that you never thought could exist. Don't let it destroy you.
Without mercy, it strikes.
Disbelief, what's become of my life.
Crashing down run me through.
I can't believe I believed in you.
Betrayer, look me in the eye.
Why am I in so much pain this time.
Without warning, trust kills.
I feel nothing and I blame you.
No remorse, no shame.
God I hate what's become of me.
Betrayer, look me in the eye.
Why am I in so much pain this time.
Betrayer, look me in the eye.
Why am I in so much pain this time.
I've been dealt a thousand lies.
So why am I in so much pain this time.
Why am I in so much pain this time.
Shut.
You.
Out.
Eye for an Eye.
Shut.
You.
Out.
Eye for an eye.

My escape, The one constant in my life that has seen me through all the highs and lows. Just like you, music is my tool to work my way through this ugly world.
Unloved, Unforgiven.
No on knows the hell that you live in.
Spirit broke with nowhere to turn.
Until I found you, I was destined to burn.
The rise of the poisoned youth.
Driven by trials, hardened by truths.
Now I am reborn inside of you.
I don't need love of forgiveness.
This you can't touch, fade to the distance.
Truth struggles to strength, it's my fuse.
Now I am reborn inside of you.
The rise of the poisoned youth.
Driven by trials, hardened by truths.
Now I am reborn inside of you.
The rise of the poisoned youth.
This is something you cannot touch.
Now I am born inside of you.
Inside you.
Rise.
Rise of.
The.
Poisoned youth.
Rise.
Rise of.
The.
Poisoned youth
Hold on to and value the love you find in this world. For many will never know how it feels.
Never alone.
You've got to know.
Know.
Your never alone.
So lost in these days, when there's nothing to believe.
I couldn't see, couldn't breath.
I turned my back on everything.
All my will, all my drive, put you to the test.
When all that you love, all that you know is pushing you to your death.
When your down reach for me.
With all you strength and I won't let go.
It's you and me against this world.
You've got to know that you're never alone.
Never alone.
You've got to know.
Know.
You're never alone.
In troubled times, I'll see you through.
I feel the strains, the same pain that you do.
When your down reach for me.
With all you strength and I won't let go.
It's you and me against this world.
You've got to know you and I are never alone.
You've got to know.
Know.
Never alone.
You've got to know.
Know.
Never alone.
The users, The leeches. The washed up. Throw the word around and have no respect for its roots, it's you I despise.
Easy come, easy go.
I'll turn on them just like I turned on you.
I guess it's safe to say.
I'll always be the enemy.
I won't unite with what I despise.
I won't unite with what I despise.
Don't you fucking look at me, and don't you say my name.
Just because you come around here.
Doesn't make us.
One and the same.
I'm carried by the truth.
I represent the pain.
Rules are rules, fools are fools.
None of them matter to me.
I won't unite with what I despise.
I won't unite with what I despise.
I won't unite.
With what I despise.
I won't unite with what I despise.
So now I turn on them, just like I turned on you.
It's you I despise; I'll never live that way.
It's you I despise; I'll never live my life that way.
I always fuck up the best things.
Empty pockets, no future for me.
Don't ask if I'm okay.
Just live your life and let me sink.
Don't ask if I'm okay.
Just live your life and let me sink.
Can't keep up this pace.
Trapped with ill fate.
Has my life been one huge mistake.
Cycle turns.
No peace of mind.
My world disintegrates.
Everything that I ever held close.
Kicked out from under me.
Nothing has shown me promise, and nothings what it seems.
I walk alone.
The city's breathing, something tells me this is right for me.
Trapped in ill fate.
Has my life been one huge mistake.
Try and draw me off my path.
Nothing falls into place.
So hard to earn, but easy to break.
I won't allow myself to be beat.
Hard to even get by.
Takes everything I fucking have just to stay alive.
Just to stay alive.
Trapped in ill fate.
Has my life been one huge mistake.
Don't ask me if I'm okay.
Just live your life and let me sink.
I always fuck up the best things.
We live and we learn.
We grow and we change.
Empty pockets, no future for me.
I won't allow myself to be beat.
Running from everything that you've ever known.
Nothings adding up, never been this low.
About time to start picking up pieces, and think about reasons of why you ended up here.
Feel the pain, you need something to live for and something to die for or you're gonna drown in the.
Misery.
Feed off the adversity.
Bury your defeats or you'll never make it through.
Feel the pain, you need something to live for and something to die for or you're gonna drown in the.
Misery.
Feed off the adversity.
Bury your defeats or you'll never make it through.
You'll never make it through.
Falling through the cracks.
Nothing left to grasp, but you won't cave in.
They're pushing you, and testing you.
But you won't cave in.
You can't cave in.
They're pushing you.
They're testing you.
You won't cave in.
Feel the pain.
You need something to live for and something to die for.
Or you're gonna drown in the.
Misery.
Feed on the adversity.
Bury your defeats or you'll never make it through.
The peaceful, beautiful world that mankind was given is now a war zone of filth and greed. We are all to blame and times just keep getting worse.
Try to keep my balance.
Sharpen my mind.
They show no mercy.
Age of Destruction.
These are violent times.
Running, running for our lives, and I think we've lost our minds.
And we're running out of time.
Conflict and chaos.
Hearts turn to stone.
Why do we live this way? Running in circles.
Running for our lives.
Never look the beast in the eye.
We've lost our minds.
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time.
And I think we've lost our minds.
This world burns.
This world burns.
And it burns.
And it burns.
Feel it burn.
It burns.
And I think we've lost our minds.
And were running out of time.
And I think we've lost our minds.
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time.
I've been lost in the negative for so long, wanting everyone and everything to crash and burn, including myself. This is about realizing the problem isn't them. It's me.
Constant walls I've built for me.
Keep them away, defiantly.
Down, down, down I'm lost again.
Devoured dreams, devastation.
I never asked to be this way.
I never asked for anything.
Redemption.
Redemption, I'm so lost again.
Redemption.
Redemption only comes from within.
Time, time, time goes slow.
Can't make sense out of thoughts of my own.
Wasted life, wasting away.
I never asked to be this way.
Constant falls into oblivion.
Pray for the worst, accept the end.
Down, down, down, can't let them in.
Isolation, desperation.
I never asked to be this way.
I never asked for anything.
Redemption.
Redemption, I'm so lost again.
Redemption, Redemption only comes from within.
I never asked to be this way.
I never asked for anything.
True change from within.
Now march on to your redemption.
I'll never forget the first time I saw Zero Tolerance or the day I got a dubbed "Victim in Pain" cassette with "Don't Forget the Struggle..." on the other side. Not to much has changed in me since then. Maybe it's me that's stuck but that's fine with me.
I can't forget this struggle.
You can't take this away from me.
From the ashes I found true strength.
Built conviction to crush what's week.
Strength of the mind.
Forced to see the other side.
With belief in self.
Through this world I reject.
Whether you like it or not, this is where I belong.
This struggle is now mine.
Hardships defined.
What's your lose or gain.
Keep your focus, keep your faith.
Men of steel rust.
Idols show true face.
Let them wash away.
I remain.
Like it or not, this is where I belong.
From the ashes I found true strength.
Built conviction to crush what's week.
For all that you have taught me, all the distant places you have taken me and all the people you've brought into my life. There is no fame or glory, just handshakes and hugs so I know that you're routing for me.
Do you feel what I feel 'cause I feel.
Do you see the things that I see? Do you hear these words that I scream? Do you still believe? Do you feel what I feel? Am I the only one that sees? Would you give it all, lay it on the line? Do you know what this means? The only truth that I ever found.
All my will remains unbound.
Unbroken, unbroken.
And I still believe.
You best believe that I still believe.
We are all human. We all make so many mistakes in our lives....don't let them add up and end yours. Pain makes great music. I know you can feel it to.
Suffer, to return harder.
I've got the scars to prove it.
Overpower.
This world never wanted me.
The product of hard luck.
The sum of all the shit that I've seen.
I choose to lay in waste because this world never wanted me.
I've felt addictions, I've felt so ugly and week.
Seen some of the best die so young.
I've done things that sicken me.
Can't show regret, nothing to say.
This world never wanted me.
I've stepped on the ones I loved.
Seen friends take there own lives.
With the bottle, I'd drown the pain.
Oh God, please help me.
Face to face with guilt, I am shame.
I've got the scars to prove it.
They strengthen me.
Can't show regret, nothing to say.
This world never wanted me.
Suffer, to return harder.
I've got the scars to prove it.
Overpower.
This world never wanted me.
Can't show regret, nothing to say.
Suffer, overpower.
I've got the scars to prove it.
Just to return harder.
I've got the scars to prove it.
Overpower.
Silence lays deadly on the wood
And stone of this evil old house
What once here walked, always walked alone
Time is ripe and I am back again
Relive past days, always deadly stained
Some might call haunted
Some call insane
Some call deranged
But I went back again
Scandal, murder, suicide, insanity
The walls are closing in with cruelsome entity
Madness, torment spiced with sheer atrocity
Sweet scent of death invites to dear monstrosity
One night the house became alive
Woke me from sleep, time was half past nine
Each room and hall was now in motion
Twisted reason into sick subversion
So call me evil
Call me insane
Call me deranged
But I'll go back again
Scandal, murder, suicide, insanity
The walls are closing in with cruelsome entity
Madness, torment spiced with sheer atrocity
Sweet scent of death invites to dear monstrosity
So call me evil
Call me insane
Call me deranged
But I'll go back again
Could I predict the storm
When constellations reach their final form
Two steps away from death I feel forlorn
As cold as stone in this world I was born
One step short of demise
Fear grows stronger than one thousand eyes
Staring at my destiny
But when it comes to leaving
I seek competence from gods
And the journey to hell
Is bound to end with a flow of blood
I welcome their shining, cold steel
To cut me so deep that my sins are forgiven
And salvation time would break free
Thus witness their will now come true
And anger distorted their long lost caresses
Of lives that I ended so cruel
Sink in the eyes again...
Sink in the eyes again
Fear strikes in lion's den
One wicked smile can win
Unleash the beast within
One step short of demise
Fear grows stronger than one thousand eyes
Staring at my destiny
But when it comes to leaving
I seek competence from gods
And the journey to hell
Is bound to end with a flow of blood
Smoggy october sea opens
And the silent heat
Of the birds is mine
Everything's seen by the invicible stars
Cold bits of fire
Just nearby
Wing moves along your thigh
And the harbor's full of departures
I count the months
Like my memories
Six white ones, six cold ones
You cannot imagine numbers like that
The whistle's like a dream
And I have returned
From the stars
Wing moves along your thigh
And the harbor's full of departures
I count the months
Like my memories
Six white ones, six cold ones
Hie hence, be gone, away
Dividing clouds reveal the day
The dawn has broken from the dark
And thou must leave my lair, so hark
It was I who rode the demon wings
That pierced their joyful purity
At night my spirit lonely sings
And feasts with bloodstained prophecy
As thoughts wage war beneath my skin
They leave bleeding wounds within
Last drop of blood, the ruin of gods
Combine in the prophet's heart
So speak, be heard
Let sickness paint this earth
Behold, stand bold
Abide to witness the rebirth
As I march through this moonlit realm
I fell these torments overwhelm
For cosmic soul would now exhale
Its demons upon this earthly veil
It was I who rode the demon wings
That pierced their joyful purity
At night my spirit lonely sings
And feasts with bloodstained prophecy
But living is swinging between life and death
False values that surely would steal your last breath
I stood on the shore counting stars upon my head
A victim I was, constellations I shed
Now virtues wept in pain
Their prophecies were so bloodstained
He spoke, was heard
And demise fled away before this howling curse
In pouring rain I drench myself
And let it wash away the pain
For life escaped from my own veins
As call of god conquered this race
It was I who rode the demon wings
That pierced their joyful purity
At night my spirit lonely sings
And feasts with bloodstained prophecy
I knew which way the wind blows
It carried me into this town
I knew about the slow death
I had to meet her in the street
And I walked on the ledges
Used menace and prayer
Covered myself with night
Covered myself with night...
So, if you think you know the wind
If you think you know...the wind
If you think you know
Just spread your wings
On wooden cross
My sweet friend died
In a flash, in a knife
I knew the wind
Like the century
Like the hole in my pocket
Until I saw the pigeons, they fly
Always towards the wind
And I walked on the ledges
Used menace and prayer
Covered myself with night
Covered myself with night...
So, if you think you know the wind
If you think you know...the wind
If you think you know
Just spread your wings
On wooden cross
Just spread your wings, just spread your wings
On wooden cross
I was told that an angel could steal my heart
Chant chaos chords and heal my inner scars
Clarified I gaze into my mind
There's more than meets the eye
Rise now and be freed of slumber
Fill veins with liquid dreams
A farewell to reality
And we shall walk the edge of time
Synthetic love divine
Behold
Powers combine
A body, soul and the chemical tide
One gentle gesture and a needle through my soul
Chromeheart and overdriven senses
Guide this endless journey
In search of an individual paradise
So come now
Together
We'll hide from death
Forever
In twilight and midnight we sense
That one more mystery's revealed
I once thought that a demon stole my heart
Promised fevered visions of one thousand arts
But humanity still chained me down
Forever stuck in this humble gown
Behold
Powers combine
A body, soul and the chemical tide
One gentle gesture and a needle through my soul
Chromeheart and overdriven senses
Guide this endless journey
In search of an individual paradise
I was told that an angel could steal my heart
Chant chaos chords and heal my inner scars
Clarified I gaze into my mind
There's more than meets the eye
Rise now and we're free of slumber
A human hand grips you
On the way to paradise
And we shall walk this earth alone
One day we will reach home
So come now
Together
We'll hide from death
Forever
In twilight and midnight we sense
That one more mystery's revealed
Sacred realm, I see this earthborn symphony
How can I dwell not far as flames still veil my heart
From thee...
Set the world on fire
Burn it bright with dark desire
Wield your hatred where my soul lies dead
Opaque my eyes as the dimmest light
Awaiting them to shine so bright
With the hate that once was hidden in my head
Raise me from this god forsaken emptiness
Release the wrath of centuries
In this portrait I am reborn
Again
Beneath these cobwebbed trees
All dancing lights has ceased
Wield your rapture where my soul lies dead
Caught in death's embrace...
Is this the sign of a permanent hell
A timeless prison cell
Where sharpened claws taste the essence of mine
Where I fall under burden of time
Linear streams go raging by
Leaving me alone to die
How can I expand my mind
When the dead caress my kind
Unleash the strenght of centuries
Call my holy name
Whence this flame towards thee came
So, set the world on fire
Burn it bright with dark desire
Wield your anger where my sword lies sharp
Raise me from this god forsaken earthborn pride
Release the wrath of centuries
In this portrait I am reborn, again...
As autumn left its last rain drops
The snow fell back on the mountain tops
I went forth to ease my pain
Storming blood inside these veins
I have no fear of this divine obscurity
Sought the truth, but ended up one foot in the grave
Curse you who drape yourself in vanity
Befool yourself until judgement day
I will not step aside in silence
Won't be slaved again
Won't befog myself with values
All in vain
Autumn rain, wash this filth away
Share this moment
With a lonely, fierce, vulgarian soul
Hear my call
I once had blood on my hands
See me fall
With the company of a madman
I will not step aside in silence
Won't be slaved again
Won't befog myself with values
All in vain
I resent this god forsaken clarity
Found the truth, but ended up both feet in the grave
Curse you who cast yourself in humility
Lower yourself until our last days
Autumn rain, wash this filth away
Share this moment
With a lonely, fierce, vulgarian soul
Hear my call
I once had blood on my hands
See me fall
With the company of a madman
Descend to the ground
Feel its warm breath around you
Pure serenity
Truly in vivo
unday night you climb in through the window of my room
I left it open just for you
Something wrong
I hear it now
I see it in your eyes
I can feel it deep inside
Mary Lou keeps telling me that everything alright
Maybe she doesn´t realize
She wants to leave
And climbs outside into the cool night air
It seems she doesn´t even care
And every time I close my window
I remember this, that final kiss
Her shadow on the wall
I hate those city lights that stare into my room
They know my pain, led her astray
And still I hear their call
[Acoustic guitar: Carl Sjöblom and Tuomas Nieminen, Grand piano: Tuomas Nieminen, Hammond: Carl Sjöblom]
Staring at the celling, trying not to think
There is an empty space where she used to be
Every little thing appears to be the same
But deep in my heart I know she´s gone away
I close my eyes and try not to weep
But I´m scared as hell to fall asleep
An old suitcase in her hand
And in her eyes I could see it´s over
It has to be goodbye
"Like the seven years that I had throw away
Now my life´s at stare, can´t wait another day"
I try to move but I don´t know how
Cause she´s all that I can think of right now
I can´t breathe, ´cos Mary Lou is dead
She´s gone without a trace
I can´t wait to see the sun go down on me
[Acoustic guitar: Carl Sjöblom, Additional vocals: Taneli Kiljunen]
Step inside my red corvette
Let me give you a ride
We´ll show these losers how to drive
Despite the acid within me
In this O.D.
A three-dollar-bill ahead
My sweet M.I. is in the trunk
With all them dead presidents there
We´ll drive to the end of the highway
Despite the acid within me
We´ll drive to the end of the highway
On flat tyres and a broken windshield
There is speed metal in the air
And we´re stuck on fifth gear
A mustang fulla eskimo´s
The mescalin must be kickin´ in
So step inside my red corvette
It only takes a while
If you agree to pay the pills
I´ll keep the engine a-rollin´
[Acoustic guitar: Carl Sjöblom]
Wait for me, don´t be so hasty
And speak to me, time cannot be wasted
Breathe for me when I feel like choking
And hold me there ´til I can´t remember
´Cause I know we could run away and lose the pain
Standing at the crossroads I would choose the same
And make the same mistake again
Something draws us back into that place where we were
Keeps us chained for years and years to come
Awaken me to a crystal morning
Sleep with me, the hours of the evening
Lead me thru the rivers of our city
And make me believe there´s something worth the waiting
´Cause I know we could run away and lose the pain
Standing at the crossroads I would choose the same
And make the same mistake again
Something draws us back into that place where we were
Keeps us chained for years and years
Can´t find a way we won´t make another day
Gothamburg I don´t know what is real
The trace in the sand
Or the wounds in my hands
Or the rest that conspire
[Hammond: Carl Sjöblom]
Open your arms
And let me sleep here
Say you will stay with me
Until the end
I´m struck down by the though of losing you
Around every corner
In every shadow I see your face
It´s getting harder to believe in pain
Every single day will be born again
Will you follow me ´till the end of the time
We´re isolated in a perfect universe
There is no right or wrong
There´s only us
No thirst or hunger
´Cos we are one
Test my innocence
Is it true
Forgive me, my darling
´Cos I´m struck down by the though of losing you
Morning breeze won´t bring much hope
Two years gone, it hurts me still
I can´t fight this guilt inside
It feel so cold, how can I hide?
I know you´re still waiting there
I see you everywhere
For it you don´t come back
It´s a world without a wonder
Oh, If you´d be here with me...
Sometimes I feel alright
But I could never live without you
If there´s a heaven, then this must be hell
It´s there years now and still it hurts
On broken streets of Gothamburg
I feel that you´re still waiting here
Can´t see you anywhere
Everyday without you
Without you, babe
And everyday it´s you
I know you ain´t waiting there
´Cause Gothamburg is everywhere
I´ve learnt to fight this guilt inside
I feel so old, I´ve lost my sight
There is nothing left for me
No place from where to leave
[Instrumental]
[Vocals: Taneli Kiljunen, French accent: Rasmus Nora]
Crawlin´ through the ruts and puddles of Gothamburg
With an empty wallet and a broken jaw
It was a bunch of Cuban fucks who beat me to the ground
I swear that I won´t rest until
Their wanton souls are circumcised
On the way back home
Jimmy black on the phone
"I found your girl from the red light zone,
She ain´t a pretty sigh no more.
I think that you should come here,
And check that things are right.
This chick just might bail out"
Stuff her in the trunk, I say
She ain´t no good alive
We can sell her spleen to the rich american
With her shoelace necklace
She´s the strangle fruit from the apple tree
But now as strange as the red room
Where lady day sings the blues
Her vocal tract slit open
She says: "Hey, what-the-heck, go break-a-neck"
[Spoken verses: Pitsa R. Tekken Jr, Spoken Outro: Rasmus Nora]
Well, we could let it slip away
We could forget about
That foolish summer night
But if you still betray
My trust another day
I swear that you won´t live
To feel the winter´s chill
Next time you won´t obey
I cannot let it slip away
My blood will start to boil
And yous bled to the soil
I stand forever locked in a cage
And I can´t lose my rage
´Til you come crawling back to me
And we´d stray through the night
I can wait until the sun comes up
And still retrieve
And we´d stray through the night
I don´t believe a word you say
I have to ask myself
How could it end this way?
You was filthy
And craved to get clean
Sure, I´ll provide you with that sweet honey beer
I´ll drug your cute little ass
With some eye-drops in your bloody Mary
Babe, this ain´t no love on the rocks with no ice
So roll the dice, beautiful
´Cos this just might be your lucky day...
The acid highway glows distant smile
Wrong directions and a dead end trail
I hate your guts
But otherwise you´re fine
Can you feel the posion moving
Can you feel it, baby?
Is nearly there
[Deep Purple cover]
We all came out to montreux
On the lake geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank zappa and the mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
We ended up at the grand hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the rolling truck stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
[Bonus Track]
[Glenn Tipton, Rob Halford & K.K. Downing]
Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its' cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descend the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood
Trust and you will be trusted,
says the liar to the fool
Lust and so what if you're busted?
In love and war there ain't no rules
Do you believe in forever?
I don't even believe in tomorrow
The only thing that lasts forever
are memories and sorrow
Out of sight out of mind
The motto of betrayal
The prophets preach to forgive and forget
I'm sorry but I am unable
You went to L'amour Saturday night
Red nails and lipstick,
dressed two sizes too tight
His tongue down your throat his hand up your skirt
Yeah I'm a man, but it still hurts
Slut, whore, cunt
You had cock on your mind and cum on you're breath
Inserted that diaphragm before you left
Practicing freelance gynecology
Where there's a womb there's a way
With you it's for free
Slut, whore, cunt
Done it before, so many times
Refused to learn your lesson
Gave till it hurt, thought it was right
Only fools make mistakes twice
So you sit home drinking alone
Empty bottle in your hand
Don't even try to sort out the lies
It's worse to try to understand
I know you're fucking someone else
Are you afraid
afraid to die?
Don't be afraid
afraid to try
Are you afraid
afraid to die?
Don't be afraid
of suicide
Just take
razor blade
and cut your wrist
down to the bone
and die laughing
Are you afraid
afraid to die?
Don't be afraid
afraid to try
suicide
Well I've got no more reason to live
And I've got no more love to give
Tonight's the night, I'll paint the town red
I'll put another hole through my head
Unjustifiable existence
Kill yourself now
Now I feel the weight of the world on my back
I see the future, the future looks black
It's what I must do I have no reservations
Ain't talking 'bout self-preservation
Unjustifiable existence
Gravity
crushing me
crushing me
crushing me
Yeah I feel something pulling me down
forcing me between myself and the ground
Of all the nightmares that ever came true,
I think that gravity is you
Unjustifiable existence
Gravity
crushing me
crushing me
crushing me
Agony and ecstasy
Your cries of pain my pleasure
to know my machine internally
Your torment I treasure
Lifeblood combined with semen
Your screaming my laughter
The compressor is running smoothly
Its vengeance I'm after
Pain
Begging becomes your lovesong
You're dying
I masturbate for the crime of burning me
I give to thee jackhammerape
jackhammerape
jackhammerape
jackhammerape
Hatred obsessing me
Hatred possessing me
Anger burning me
Anger turning me
Into someone I don't know
Rage that's shaking me
Rage that's making me
Into someone I don't know
I'll kill you tonight
Yeah I'll kill you tonight
Hey Peter, where you going with that axe in your hand
Hey Peter, where you going with that axe in your hand
I'm gonna kill my lady cause I caught her screwing around with
some other men
I'm gonna kill my lady cause I caught her fucking around with
some other men
Hey Peter, I heard you cut your woman down
Hey Peter, I heard you cut your woman down, cut her down to
the ground
Last night I killed my lady cause I caught her screwing around
with every guy in town
Last night I killed my lady cause I caught her screwing around
all over this town
hey Peter, where you're gonna run to now
hey Peter, where you're gonna go
I'll take that D-train, take it down to Brighton Beach, to bay
I'll take that D-train, take it down to Brighton Beach,
Brighton Beach
I'll see my baby to heaven
I'll see my baby to heaven
Finished with my woman, she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane, cause I am frowning all the time
All day long I think these things, but nothing seems to satisfy
I think I'll loose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
Can you help him feel love
Cause he's not made of steel
Oh no, no
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be
blind
Make a joke and I will sigh, and she will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words telling you now my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could but it's too late
Can you help me feel love
Cause I'm not made of steel
Oh no, no
I got a pickaxe in the trunk of my car
I'll put it on the grinder to get it real sharp
There's an ugly green monster in my head
It won't leave me alone until you're dead
I called your house but you couldn't be reached
So took the D train to Brighton Beach
You're doing the thing with a brand new man
Checking out the stars screwing on the sand
Kill you
Kill you
Punishment
Kill you
You took some steroids and adrenaline
Finlandia vodka and hallucinagens
Mixed it with blood and orange juice
Liquid protein and ice cubes
Staring down at your sweaty embraces
Put my tool right through your faces
Well buddyboy hope you enjoyed her
Cause I am an equal opportunity destroyer
Kill you
I'll kill you tonight
The first to admit - I'm a doomed drug addict
And I always will be - hey man, don't follow me
No excuse for drug abuse
Said these lines a thousand times
Don't want to live atrial fib - from neurosis, cerosis
Please make me smile - if you learn from my trial
Baby I'll pay this price - maybe saving your life for ya
I can't state this point enough
The pickup's easy, but the put down's rough
Up the nose or tap a vein - no one else but you to blame
I can't believe I died last night - oh God I'm dead again
I can't believe I died last night - I'm fucking dead again
Chemical joy turning thee paranoid
Recently buried deep Greenwood Cemetery, now
I had no pulse last time I checked
I'd trade my life for self respect
So I say with my ass whipped
There are some things worse than death
I can't believe I died last night - oh God I'm dead again
I can't believe I died last night - I'm fucking dead again
Say the word and I'll be healed
opened eyes grease my wheels
Since my vision's be restored
Trip me once shame on you
Trip me twice I'm the fool
Thought it's hidden I've been cured
Patience is divine but the virtue is not mine
Turn you cheek gets ripped off
That's why God gave us four
This is how you spend life
Amused by another's strife
Makes me so sad and confused
Someone's pain you leisure
Can't explain sick pleasure
I'm so glad I'm not you
Patience is divine but the virtue is not mine
Turn you cheek gets ripped off
That's why God gave us four
Throwing wrenches gave a false sense of power
What started sweet will soon turn sour
You think it's your place to dispense justice
Well I've been sent to judge the judges
God damn love 'cause it's breaking my heart
And if I had one wish I'd see in the dark
Tripping a blind man so easy to do
Tripping a blind man why can't it be you?
You want to play God and I know you will
If that's the case I'll be the devil
Now who the fuck are you to discipline me
Innocence condemned by the guilty?
God damn love 'cause it's breaking my heart
And if I had one wish I'd see in the dark
Tripping a blind man so easy to do
Tripping a blind man why can't it be you?
Losing his grip of his seeing eye dog's spikey collar
Panicking, the startled pet ran to the street
Sanitation truck skidding unable to stop
Shoveled up what was left of his canine spot
As they left, the ground turned muddy crimson
Where's my mutt? The victim requested
EMS responded "he had to say bye"
Teary eyed, the old man cried then died
Patience is divine but the virtue is not mine
Turn your cheek gets ripped off
That's why God gave us four
Goodbye cruel world.
Of this shape a star of five
Also applies to the one with six sides
Against the sun and against the moon
I warn you that these two combined
Will bring man's doom
Of ten horns and seven heads
Count your fingers and the continents
On your head or in you right hand
This new moral code that the media commands
Believe not in their clever words
Because faith inacted are the loudest heard
All these things I say are true
Understood sadly by a chosen few... you
The end my friend in not near the hour in fact is quite here
When the moon becomes red to guide the risen dead
This means God's turned his back on you
I am a prophet of doom
I am the profit of doom
So now the star has fallen washing away the seas
The seventh seal now opens it's raining your fears
Are you paranoid the coming asteroid
Has got your name tattooed on it
This stone's called Apophis it brings Apocalypse
I am a prophet of doom
I am the profit of doom
Speak the name of He created thee all to be which should not be spoken
No laws broken
Now life and love the stars above which fall upon thee all that worship the beast
Influence ceased
My soul's on fire
My faith is an amber burning ever working towards a greater reward
Serving my Lord
Built his home upon the rock not of the flock but coming as a shepherd
Guarding his herd
My soul's on fire
September sun glowing golden hair
Now keep in mind son she was never there
October's rust bisecting black storm clouds
Only the deaf hear my silent shouts
Yet in the dark still he screams your name
Nights living death with witch rhymes insane
Ten years amassed para toda mi vida?
Lost man in time was his name Peter
September sun rotted Flatbush porch
I would have run then had I known the cost
Autumnal rays turned your eyes to stone
Did it give you pleasure to steal my soul?
Leave her alone
I said leave her alone
Me? I know why
The dead they got that morbid beat it goes deo deo
They dance upon decaying feet with their black toes oh no
Heaven, Limbo and Hell - purgatory oh well oh well
Halloween in Heaven - it's Christmas in Hell
Halloween in Heaven oh well oh well
The devil stole a yule tree decorated with souls
Jesus trick or treating as him below
Heaven, Limbo and Hell - purgatory oh well oh well
Halloween in Heaven - it's Christmas in Hell
Halloween in Heaven oh well oh well
Bonham on drums, Entwistle on bass as guest morticians
Bon Scott on vox, Rhoads just for kicks, on guitar Hendrix
Lennon sits in with his friend George but where is Morrison?
Of course I cried when I heard they'd died and took a part of me
Same time gave from beyond the grave became what was to be
Elvis ain't dead so he isn't here party never ends
Demon roadies, angel groupies, suicide losers
If only I'd known how cool death is I'd have killed myself sooner
Of harps and choirs, pumpkin pine pyres, flames of red and green
Orange and black, years take me back - Christmas or Halloween
Halloween in Heaven - it's Christmas in Hell
Halloween in Heaven oh well oh well
The child is torn from the womb unbaptised
There's no question it's infanticide
I'm guilty so therefore condemned
Destroying angels must come to an end
Now in Limbo deprived of paradise not so nice
At the end I'll escort you to hell
The dark one's forces lock your flaming cell
To murder the one's unborn
The worst sin you've ever performed
There are two other things I must tell know them well
With due respect hear these words of caution
If considering and abortion
If you did boiling sulphur
To which I will not concur
Leading to a path of misfortune no one won
Of a land, land that shuns the son
Should there be failure to convert Zion?
What came as a lamb returning as a lion
Not a nation but a self proclaimed state
The road to redemption leads to through deserts
Rocky though the trip through is well worth it
I am the duel of the fisherman Simon
He brought alpha, omega, yes I'm the one
The twins fell beginning Armageddon
So the whore too who dwelleth in Babylon
All his people gathered round - through forgiveness salvation found
She burned me down, down to the ground
Blood - though thicker than water - is harder to clean up
You'll get it in the end boy if the weapon of choice is love
Expecting it from a stranger or maybe an acquaintance
Never from family or friends though a simple mistake and expense
She burned me down, down to the ground
Pissed and disappointed I prey to learn to forgive
If I can't find it in my heart then I have no reason to live
Here is an education - the lesson professed is quite cruel
There are some things worse than death and one of them is you
Every time I see her start a fire I get higher
I can't play God forgiveness is hard
Forgiving also hard too
I have my orders
Blood's thicker than water
Though much harder to clean up
IOI in on it, IOI in on it - never forget
Punching in walls to prove I've got balls
Only got me busted knuckles
Therapy is slow
And jail is a no
A rotting tit on which I suckle
IOI in on it, IOI in on it - never forget
Some stupid tomorrow - some stupid today
Some stupid tomorrow - go away, go away
Yesterday
Been given the keys I knew I'd receive
Be careful what you're asking for
Thy rod and thy staff simply twelve toned math
An earful opening all doors
Simon the roman gone fission for man
If you're caught is to be freed
Come open your lock by using a rock
Or sowing the proper seeds
Woe to thee all woman of land, air and sea
Adam was the serpent apple 'tween his knees
Seduced by a snake worshiped by nations
Banished forth, from Eden it's the male who is Satan
From the tree of knowledge (a metaphor for sex)
Plucked a ripened globs of fruit that of her innocence
Since forbidden resisted forcing her to taste
Now I know why girls hate boys 'cause Eve was in fact raped
We ain't going home - got nowhere to go
Once upon a slime I thought you royalty
I would never have questioned your loyalty
Don't act so surprised, saw through you disguise
But with friends like you prefer my enemies
Up until recently never had a clue
In a way I must admit I pity you
I'm through with you kind, 'cause you've wasted my time
Please do not release them, Lord knows what they do
I can't believe how cruel life is
Emotional blackmail makes me sick, oh so sick
Who is to blame for constant shame on you
These words I use don't confuse with cool
This misfortune not lost but won deserved
Choosing is hard careful which God you serve
Traitors many, surrounding me cowards
Conspiracy so clear to see flowers
We were brothers 'til discovered deceit
Tried with treason that's the reason you're beat
I can't believe how cruel life is
Emotional blackmail makes me sick, oh so sick
All hail and farewell to Britain, all hail and farewell to thee
All hail and farewell to England, all hail and farewell to me
I've seen it turn from white to red
I've heard you talk about how
you bleed and it doesnt mean shit
until I see some action a hint of
rose and a mountain of garbage
leaves me for dead and nothing drags me from
breaking myself
breaking myself to try to keep everyone
from walking over me
smell the burning wreckage of even you
all of your perfection lets get inside
forget we even met cause it all comes
down to this the good ones always
leave in the end
breaking myself
breaking myself to try to keep everyone
from walking over me
I see the world and it all looks blue
I kiss the world and it all tastes true
The blurry eyes make me appealing
you will become very friendly
your liquidation is a siren song
you swim I follow Im feeling my head sink
so as to reach and touch what hurts me
still I try to reach and touch what hurts me
I'm chewing my tongue
it makes it so numb 
my lower coverings 
house many children 
so many piercings 
I can't stop bleeding 
trails are all I see 
can't help being me 
I am so cool 
so fucking different 
I am so cool 
so fucking different 
we're all the same 
so very different 
so fucked up we drool 
it's all the same 
so many tweakings 
I can't stop peaking 
my fucking parents 
after school meetings 
I've got not future 
won't even try 
I'm failing at life 
get high and then I die
Shit filled spasms
deep in the colostomy bag 
I like being trapped inside 
the plastics wearing out 
red and perfect 
her legs spread out in front of me 
they're so open they make me sweat 
it's my lubrication 
recent findings 
say circumcise the abstinent 
and make it hard for them to breathe 
I like to make you lie 
dropped and so ill 
steeped in my misogyny 
my shaking hands are in the skin 
I've gone to far too soon 
you look so seamless now 
she stared at me 
thinking I was sweet to it 
her legs tied up 
apart for me 
it feels so good inside 
now I'm thinking 
who's this that lies under me 
and needs a piece of my respect 
you make me so sick, I'm 
crawling, broken 
my face is cringing to see 
figures drawn inside of you 
succumb succumb succumb 
sickness fittings 
procured this fascist medium 
but now I'm laughing in your face 
you lie you lie you lie 
you look so seamless now 
take me 
take my life
Pathetic sympathies
left for the bleeding at heart 
everything fades to shit 
everything tears me apart 
caustic insecurities 
surface above the withheld 
everytime I need 
everything I want 
aesthetic disguises 
confuse easier tasks 
underlying doubts unfold 
and my direction dies 
everything's right up in your face 
everyone's right up in front 
push me against the wall 
but still you can't make me 
FALL 
Prosthetic misery 
idiosyncratic 
pushing me to never 
hold my breath 
synthetic misuses 
dragging me higher still 
you never brought me to 
and still you push me back 
anemic discipline 
produces bad thoughts 
everybody's wrong 
everybody's too strong 
everything's right up in your face 
everyone's right up in front 
push me against the wall 
but still you can't make me 
FALL 
Separate your mouth 
Scrape away your skin 
I DON'T LIKE YOU AT ALL
Follow me now and I will drown you
fill you full of reason 
no windows | I'll take you 
to the dirty place that I love 
slipping on messes you made when I hit you 
makes me more excitable 
I'll never get caught 
I'll never get caught 
pull it tight I'll see right through it 
I'll Never Get Caught 
Cradle the difference in front of your fist 
force it down to bring it back up and make them 
listen one more time 
Wrapping you up in an American flag 
I fuck you for the glory 
no complaints 
from my friends 
they keep their fucking mouths shut 
I couldn't care less about the way that you see me 
soothing I will never be 
I'll always get shit 
I'll always get shit 
for acknowledging perversity
Your mom didn't tell you
you'd have nothing to say 
shut the fuck up bitch 
in a poisoned state 
while the rapist behind you 
is whispering your name 
my lies foreshadow me 
they make a scab of me 
I can't crawl through this 
you can't shut me up 
you can't shut me up 
make it rough 
what 
difficulty breathing makes you drip 
swallowing on first dates entertains 
I scream mistakenly 
I'm trying to make you see 
what makes him resent you 
that's right I lie 
solid filth til I die 
but it makes me smile 
lord of the elite 
is prince of the cowards 
try not to choke on it 
you can't shut me up 
you can't shut me up 
make it rough 
what 
difficulty breathing makes you drip 
swallowing on first dates entertains 
misogynist attracted to you 
wallowing in pity's comfortable 
what 
get up
Decide everything for me
subject yourself to it 
make believe it's only your fault 
stifle my own 
ambition 
It's been so long since I failed 
nothing alienates this 
anything reminds me 
relieving it only helps 
suffer to make your own gains 
It's been so long since I failed 
and now my senses fail me 
and still my training fails me 
and now everything fails me 
and still everyone fails me 
and still the only thing I have fails me
Beautiful disease
trying to stop those fleas 
resist complacences 
for what you seize 
sinister laughing in back corners of my mind 
provides my sustinence 
a no handed attempt 
a rude man at the front 
the right bowed to but dead 
accomplished undertone 
shoveling to the def 
out of your other lips 
but making me happy 
three in the front room 
are fucking on top of my bed 
uplifting opening 
old scars thought of as healed 
say your prayers for your hate 
a nympho to yourself 
and now my face it breathes my lies 
and my lies, they make me drown
The crowd did move
was it live 
the course it took 
was it right 
the crown I wore 
was it mine 
the lips that lie 
is it true 
the lace that tears 
is it skin 
the line that binds 
is it real 
the face that smiles 
is it yours 
the fall that kills 
is it dead 
to control the mannequin 
your wrists will shake 
without circulation 
your face will twitch 
do you feel 
better than me 
do you taste 
better than me 
the prey that hunts 
was it found 
the people die 
is it right 
the place is lost 
will it turn 
the guilt that hurts 
will it change 
the guess that shames 
will it smile 
the game that plays 
does it hurt 
the fail that's right 
does it taste 
the fuck that hates 
do you care 
did you get 
what you wanted 
to taste acid 
to taste guilt 
to taste shame 
to taste hate 
to taste death 
to taste black 
to taste acid 
to taste red 
to taste hell 
to taste me 
for you to swell 
to taste god 
to taste acid
I step with two hands open
and kick the man in front of me 
reminded of my father 
when will you ever learn 
I found you urinating 
you found me interesting 
torn raw and feeling sickness 
permit my hypocrisy 
feel the thick curtain 
while she sleeps 
the stench of my breath pains you 
but your just smelling yourself 
my plate shows something rotten 
I feel so right at home 
dress me in mothers clothing 
to teach me how to fuck myself 
fracture my arm like you know 
the abuse makes it feel right 
feel the thick curtain 
while she sleeps
I know this much
I can't stand me 
when I become him 
I know this much 
I don't feel free 
when I'm repentant 
tell him this much 
you don't want him 
due to extra skin 
tell him this much 
you forsake him 
due to pretension 
and now we have 
everything we need 
to come up to 
where you're pristine 
we believe 
tell him this much 
you can't withstand 
taking it upright 
tell him this much 
you felt dirty 
because it was tight 
I know this much 
that old feeling 
I'm done hanging on 
I know this much 
enough pretending 
what was had is gone 
and now we have 
everything we need 
to come to where 
up you are clean 
we believe
Hey I want your skin to get me off
you make it sound so fucking pure 
I'll bring you down and make you scream 
take in what you once thought was hate 
and now I want to make it right 
and you can't take that away from me 
strive to make you cower like a pig 
sit and squirm in your own stink 
you have been the sickest of them all 
gone back to the way it never worked 
did you want me to mistreat you 
did you want me to pretend
An overwhelming understanding
of chaos brings you to your knees 
impurities make me the way that I am 
the dirt in my veins 
the games on my thoughts 
the stains on your face 
they break it apart 
Pushing the envelope 
Life sets me off 
Pushing the envelope 
Hate gets me off 
Motherfucking 
Pushing the envelope 
gets me off 
Pushing the envelope 
your face it sets me off 
I'm curled up inside myself so I won't imagine the pictures 
If I had prosthetic eyes I still think I'd see the same 
satisfy retribution in lies 
to resemble innocence in lies 
subsequent afternoon's turning scared 
bothered by fallacies everyone's scared 
Pushing the envelope 
Life sets me off 
Pushing the envelope 
Hate gets me off 
Motherfucking 
Pushing the envelope 
gets me off 
Pushing the envelope 
your face it sets me off 
Killing myself like a tool in wrong 
Disquieting changes in direction
Play your games with my limp joints
idolize it's wet paper skin 
listen to the cast preach your life 
and infest you with disease 
dress me up with a three piece tourniquet 
fuck and get under the scabs 
never trust what you cannot kill 
and pretend that she respects you 
pursuit of liberty 
drags you all across this country 
this cunt bleeding 
delivered me 
the cord it stretches 
taught and only so far 
before it snaps back 
giving us relief 
it's just a matter of time 
it's just a matter of time 
before you fall down 
and hurt yourself 
far from home 
with no one's help 
we will be waiting 
but his eyes can't see the madness 
so she can keep the rule 
formulate what will be that thing that makes me laugh 
your next manipulation 
of the all too friendless 
always seen and never noticed 
dipping my feet in pools of you 
FUCK YOU 
make my face only how you like it 
why can't you smell it hide 
wreck her pussy with your fist 
she'll be your minister 
violate my stiff limp body 
only to taste my glass bloodline 
shove it all behind my back 
cauterize my open wound 
I never needed to leave 
to find out what makes me tick 
I arrived by default 
my arms three grand long 
but not elastic enough 
to care for insects 
just beyond my reach 
it's just a matter of time 
it's just a matter of time 
before I pick you up 
and dust you off 
kiss the eyes 
that make me rough 
I will be waiting 
I walked beside myself 
but nothing ever changed 
and now I walk away 
so you can take the blame 
clinical distortion 
affects the bachelor 
I still can't find
It's just a reason to deny
All the limits that border
On the thinnest frailties
That makes a sudden change
I'll play my soul into sleep
I'll make up words that i keep
Letting nothing go to anyone at all
Where is your loyalty now?
When all the cards have been left one the table
All of them
Bleed at the nerves That take so long to wear down
I'll play my soul into sleep
I'll make up words that i keep
Letting nothing go to anyone at all
Where is your loyalty now?
When all the cards have been left one the table
This time I have made enough mistakes
For you to bear against me
Endure and break
Our original ideals
That let us down
And betray our trust
Like all your promises
I've seen the piece of shit alive in you
Cause I'm there enough to be here too
We're just the braces amidst
These selfish trials and fits
Not so safe or scared or dumb is the rest
Our unraveling has just
Enough of it here to be
Down propped up and watching
You stare at us pull you down
You read the news
You take the vows
You blame the costs
We play the chords
Now the only course
That traces an end
To the violence
Has left us without any
Chance to stand our ground
...Stand up and...
March
Get back in line and
Fight
The time to start is
Now
Don't let yourself play the
Fool
There's no way out
Placatingly wound we search
Without purpose the game ends
Promise me today 
So tomorrow's a new surprise
All these sores lingering
Shutdown and loving it
The greedy hands will lie
But we stand ready to strike
Yours' is the blood
Theirs' the thirst
The speed the greed
The machines and the paper dolls
We didn't want this
We didn't need this
We couldn't see it coming
But we're to blame for it
...Stand up and...
March
Get back in line and
Fight
The time to start is
Now
It's been after me
In this place
A present threat perfect void
Stuck in modality
With all this damage beyond repair
When all our time fades away
Just like everything else
That proves that we are
Dirt 
Stay now just in case
Selfish trials
Keep stopping to
Drag me down
And losing bliss
As if all your hands
Could keep me clean
When all our time fades away
Just like everything else
That proves that we are
Dirt
I can't see where I've gone wrong
All our time fades away
And proves that we are
Dirt
If all our time fades away
It's proof we're dirt
Ridicule my own
So precious alone
These faces of everyone
Remind me of home
You're plotting riddled sin
All my needs giving in
Blow me a kiss
And leave me to the dogs
So, you think you got it
You think you know
You wanna bring me down
I am in my finest hour
Ridicule my own
So precious alone
These faces of everyone
Remind me of home
You're watching me dying
How am I looking?
Why don't you take a picture
You're plotting riddled sin
All my needs giving in
Blow me a kiss
And leave me to the dogs
My fear, traps me waiting for it
My past if glowing red and yellow, again
Run, back where you came form
Not that i matters
I'll never see you again
My fists strain to sift mercy
Ridicule my own
So precious alone
These faces of everyone
Remind me of home
You're plotting riddled sin
All my needs giving in
Blow me a kiss
And leave me to the dogs
My fear, traps me waiting for it
My past is glowing red and yellow, again
My fate will show me where to follow
This most unwitting occurrence
Is indeed about you
So take it
Or chalk it up
All these others before me
Can't give what I doubt
Take what I've taken
The three of threes
Professes you to me
Challenging and the favor will be
Paid in full
Pounds of flesh
In perfect dress
Take what I've taken
This most unwitting occurrence
This most unwitting occurrence
Is indeed about you
So take it
Or chalk it up
All these others before me
Can't doubt
What's killing you
Wells from inside
Atonement for the waste
Pleasure in one more accolade
Prehensive doubt prehensive...
One day, I know when I see you
Far from these days that beat us
Far from my habits perfect prison
You
Always get exactly what you want
You 
This is only my life that you taunt
Always giving me enough to keep me quiet
Only giving me enough to keep me at bay
Why don't you leave me alone
I don't need you
This
Is the very thing that I disgust
Promise me again
And I hope your jaw fucking rusts
I did what you wanted didn't I?
Why don't you leave me alone
Always on the verge of something
Almost about to leave it all
I don't need you
Open your blessed wings
And wrap them around all your things
Keep yourself in the company of kings
Cause it's there hands' that bleed from the strings
No more
Money is hate
So love me now
While I'm still unimportant enough to be
I will prove myself
And absence a shadow
I will never be what you don't deserve
Cause it's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better
Follow me and you'll find
Your reflection is not even close to your's anymore
Images patterned on dreams on your secrets
Poisoning connections as you slide away from gone
Cause it's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
From you
We're dirty and hungry and bitter and tired and broke and bruised and battered so happy
I've been here way too long
Money is hate
So love me now
While I'm still unimportant enough to be
I will prove myself
And absence a shadow
I will never be what you don't deserve
Cause it's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better
Stalking the currency shifts
As cause becomes
Embedded codes digital mistakes
So all the rest can
Choke for need and strain to bleed
The hunger I fix a taste for the feeding
This panic perpetuating poison upon us
As it plagues me into
Running the gamut again
Surprise you're wrong
I'm not the defects for ones
You left out
Erratic an addict
Is leading my fall
Back to the faces
My weaknesses live
Shots down and riding the bomb
Routine submissive disease
Just let me rot
Done with all these innocence thieves
While all us weak ones
Choke for need and strain to bleed
The hunger I fix a taste for the feeding
This panic perpetuating poison upon us
As it plagues me into
Running the gamut again
Surprise you're wrong
I'm not the defects for ones
You left out
Erratic an addict
Is leading my fall
Back to the faces
My weaknesses live
Shots down and riding the bomb
I want to be
Somewhere far from here
I'm watching you
As you wave goodbye
I won't take
I won't weigh you down
Following suit
So just count me out
I can't get it out
Can't put it together
I should've known better
Than to turn into this
Fiend
I can't believe
I've become removed
Tighten the line
And pull up hello
I will change
I won't weigh me down
Carving this space
Never count me out
I can't get it out
Can't put it together
I should've known better
Than to turn into this
Fiend
I say
Everything's how it ought to be
I say
Nothing should ever change
I say
I only know how it used to be
I say
I don't want a fucking thing to do with it
This is the way to find my harlequin's face
To my junkie dead body
Still covered in lace
The flesh still warm where skin had once been
My smile just scattered fragments lining the ditch
You like to watch when I bleed
(like a coward)
I've got some right here for you
I push you down on your knees
(such a good whore)
I make your dreams come true
in hybrid mental states
So my pathetic limp kiss has never caught this way
No catalyst begins across the face of those
who end
Leaving it's scar too deep for all of your
attempts to mend
Come on cowards
Come on you whores
I've got no choice but this if
I can't get rid of it
You'll never be any match 
For what I can do to myself
I'm still stuck here breaking it backwards apart
Watching all the raindrops cover up before
we can start
(like a coward)
Without a doubt that all will be washed away
There's still no proof to see if I will someday
You like to watch when I bleed
(like a coward)
I've got some right here for you
I push you down on your knees
(such a good whore)
I make your dreams come true
I've got no choice but this if
I can't get rid of it
You'll never be any match 
For what I can do to myself
Have you any idea
What it's like to be me
Watching you succeed and move forward
All my wasted time tensing in anticipation
My thought process
Full grown and worthless
Safe when nobody is in your heart now
Take everything you can get your hands on
Save me save me from this yearning yet again
I have become what I always knew
I have become what I always knew
Every salvageable breath choked off in fear
I am the last thing I'll ever expect form me
Safe when nobody is in your heart now
Take everything you can get your hands on
Save me save me from this yearning yet again
Have you any idea
What it's like to be me
Riding hard, high in the saddle
Winged steed of unwearing flight
Sweeping through air just like fire
Swift of the foot, great of might
Hear the screams
Feel the bite
We ride with death
Tonight
Here it comes
You better hide
Shoot the guns
You're gonna die
Conquering all, spreading terror
Hoofs gallop in thunderous pound
Devouring the souls of the wretched
Trampling them down to the ground
Gripping the reins of destruction
Made of steel on his hands
Holder of forces immortal
Slaughtering all in his path
Racing down the road
In a street machine of steel
Gears are jammed in full
I'm the madman at the wheel
Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engine roar
I got thunder in my hands
I'm metal thrashing mad
Driving like a maniac
Can't go any faster
Burning up the road
Headed for disaster
[Originally performed by Alice Cooper]
Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and downs
I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I don't know what I want
Eighteen, I just don't know what I want
Eighteen, I got to get away
I got to get out of this place
I'll go runnin' in outer space!
I've got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talking about
Feels like I'm living in the middle of doubt
'Cause I'm eighteen, I get confused every day
Eighteen, I just don't know what to say
Eighteen, I've got to get away
Lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form from the left and right
I'm in the middle, the middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I like it
Move it to the front
Reaching for the light
Loosing all control
Using all your might
Wheels are gonna spin
Asses gonna shake
We are gonna kick
Walls are gonna break
The road is hard
The fight is tough
Gonna play it fast
She likes it rough
With my strength
With all my soul
Makin' love
I'm losing control
Guts begin to churn
Minds are in haze
Hell is gonna burn
Axes in a blaze
Go in for the kill
Always on the run
Fighting for you life
The battles never won
Move it to the front
Reaching for the light
Losing all control
Using all your might
Wheels are gonna spin
Asses gonna shake
We are gonna kick
Walls are gonna break
Backs are turned
Rock and roll
To the wall
I'm losing my mind
Out in the streets
We're fighting tonight
We're dirty and mean
So run for you lives
We stand side by side
With our fists in the air
We live for the night
On the razor's edge
Unleashing the sound
Lashing out, striking down
All those who stand in the way
Taking their lives
Crushing them just like flies
The cries of the wounded in pain
Fighting the fight
As we race through the night
With power like never before
Hammering, bashing them,
Pounding and smashing them
Hard so we won't take a fall
Like a raging inferno
We'll torture and burn (you)
Up in a sea of flame
We'll beat you and whip you
Of honor, we'll strip you
Down on your knees and beg
We're fighting it out till the end
We're living our lives for the sins
We are fighting for your lives
Oh, we are the soldiers in the line of fire
Down in the trenches we wait for the night
The time is approaching
We're ready to strike
We'll stop at nothing
There's no holding back
Born to raise hell
We will attack
Pounding away
Tearing through flesh
Soldiers of metal
Fight to the death
Blasting the cannons
Shaking the ground
Hacking and killing
We're not fooling around
Warriors in battle
All dressed in black
A slash and a thrust
A stab in the back
The rages of fury
The cause of the fight
We're soldiers of metal
And we rule the night
Like the screaming eagle
I'm on the run
I blaze through the sky
I kill for the fun
No reason, no warning
Not shadow be found
Got you in my sights
And I'll shoot you down
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Turbo jet engines ignite
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Death will filling the sky
Jet fighter, jet fighter
An airborne assault and attack
Jet fighter, jet fighter
A cold blooded stab in the back
Vengeance is calling on you
And there's nothing that you can do
Brings you the thing you deserve
Death from above!
The chains of oppression
We'll break with our teeth
Before degradation
We'd die at your feet
So ruthless and vicious
To have no remorse
He who lives by the sword
Die by the sword
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Turbo jet engines ignite
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Death will filling the sky
Jet fighter, jet fighter
An airborne assault and attack
Jet fighter, jet fighter
A cold blooded stab in the back
Vengeance is calling on you
And there's nothing that you can do
Brings you the thing you deserve
Death from above!
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Turbo jet engines ignite
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Death will filling the sky
Jet fighter, jet fighter
An airborne assault and attack
Jet fighter, jet fighter
A cold blooded stab in the back
Vengeance is calling on you
And there's nothing that you can do
Brings you the thing you deserve
Death from above!
Steel shattered in the night
Soldiers racing to the fight
Bombs waiting to explode
Fear is cast up on your soul
It's just around the corner
For those who dare to see
With eyes of fire
The burn right through me
Blood painted on the streets
Metal cutting into meat
You can see it in my eyes
Pain that never will subside
And you can feel the power
On evil it will feed
The force that surrounds me
It brings me to my knees
We better run for cover
There's no time to waste
'Cause if you turn your back now
It'll blow you away, yeah!
[instrumental]
Abandon all hope for those who enter
Cause there ain't too much of that down here
A clouded mist in a darkened tunnel
And twisted screams are growing near
Now you're down here, you're gonna all stay
Cause the howling furies wanna come out and play
You're headed for doom, you'd better prepare
Cause in this part of the woods almost anything's fair, yeah
You lied and cheated in your miserable life
You met your end with a butcher knife
We laughed when you died, you sit in your grave
Just waiting to turn into Satan's slave
Disease, Disease
Spreading the disease
With some help from Captain Trips
He'll bring the world down to his knees
Power, yes Power
He'll show them all his power
It pulses through his ice cold blood
A whole world to devour
[PRE-CHORUS:]
He's seeing, He's calling
His legacy, He's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living
Murder, Murder
Commit cold blooded murder
Like Nazis during World War Two
They only follow orders
Hatred, Hatred
A crucifix is your bed
Once he turns his eye on you
You'd be better off dead
[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]
[CHORUS:]
I am the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with power
Among the living
Follow me or die
Man, fights Man
Divided they can't stand
United they can battle back
And make him force his hand
Fear, yes Fear
His end is growing near
He didn't count on man's good faith
And their will to persevere
[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]
[REPEAT CHORUS]
[LEAD BREAK]
Fire, hot Fire
Purge the world with fire
Damnation is the price he'll pay

Fifteen years in the academy
He was like no cadet they'd ever seen
A man so hard, his veins bleed ice
And when he speaks he never says it twice
They call him Judge, his last name is Dredd
So break the law, and you may wind up dead
Truth and justice are what he's fighting for
Judge Dredd the man, he is the law
DROKK IT
With his gun and bike he rules the streets
And every perp he meets will taste defeat
Not even Death can overcome his might
Cause Dredd and Anderson, they won the fight
When the Sov's started the Apocalypse war
And Mega-city was bombed to the floor
Dredd resisted, and the judges fought back
And crushed the Sov's with their counter-attack
DROKK IT
[PRE-CHORUS:]
Respect the badge - he earned it with his blood
Fear the gun - your sentence may be death
because ...
[CHORUS:]
I AM THE LAW
And you won't fuck around no more - I AM THE LAW
I judge the rich, I judge the poor - I AM THE LAW
Commit a crime I'll lock the door - I AM THE LAW
Because in Mega-City ...
I AM THE LAW
In the cursed earth where mutants dwell
There is no law, it's just a living hell
Anarchy and chaos as the blood runs red
But this would change if it was up to Dredd
The book of law is the bible to him
And any crime committed is a sin
He keeps the peace whith his law-giver
Judge, jury, and executioner
DROKK IT
[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]

It started back in high-school
So cool, king of the scene
You found that making people laugh
Was more than just a dream
The public took right to you
Like flies to a pile of shit
So funny and smart so talented

And when you couldn't see your own dependency
N.F.L., NICE FUCKIN' LIFE !
The whole world is your playground
Yet you can't find your niche
Your only friends it helps you through
Helps you dig your daily ditch
The bottom line can't touch you
Cause you're above the rest
But your little friend's the enemy
And the bottom line is death

[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]

All American, an evil game of extortion
A sick old man, and who would guess

A deadly fascination, of a madman's solution
Six million dead, poison tales pollute his head

Tell me a story - Will ya, Will ya
A real good story, I won't leave till ya
Spill your guts old man
Leave out any secrets, Hiding in the ...

Any skeletons in the closet
Any skeletons, any misfortunes
Any skeletons, Hiding in the closet
Any skeletons, Any skeletons

Apt pupil, he hears the screams
Nightmares turn into wet dreams
Hatret lives, boiling inside, dealing death it's bumicide
In too deep, their secret stands but it won't keep

The truth comes out, conspiracy there is no doubt

There's nothing I hate more, than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises, and all their plastic deals
They just can't be themselves, and live their own lives out
They're just an imitation of what life's all about
"Because of me you are who you are
So sign your name, and you'll go far
I'm your friend, I think you should
So sign your name, it's for your own good"
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD THIS TODAY ???
Some bogus piss-on saying "Let's do lunch babe"
For them this bullshit, it's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife
IMITATION OF LIFE
[BRIDGE ONE]
OOOOOOOOH, OOOOH, OH
ANGER BURNS
Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story had an unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend
"Take my advice, listen to me
A great opportunity, can't you see
I only want what's best for you
The deal of a lifetime, what more can I do"
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD THIS TODAY ???
Some stupid sucker says "It's great, we luv ya babe"
For them this bullshit, it's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife

OOOOOOOOH, OOOOH, OH

Bands dress like women, with hairspray and lace
I'd pass an image law, stick it in their face

Wearing this image twenty four hours a day ...

What the hell gives you the right to
Take what's been done, before
Change the name and make it yours, Oh

Do you have to be so blatant
Your so conscious, image

You're a train ride to no importance

Rainy day genius clouds your mind
Don't you realize the blind lead the blind
You're anti, you're antisocial
Oh mister time will you ever unwind
Or just rebuild a new design
Your claim to fame is law and order
The rich get rich, the poor get poor
You put a price tag on what you see
This one's for you, that's for me
If that's winning I'd rather lose
Why don't you listen to my senseless views
You're anti, you're antisocial

No one knows your name
Living in the street
Moms and kids with nothing to eat
Welfare hotels
Who says there's no place called hell
I can't see you
I can't hear you

Open your eyes

Invisible could be my name
Your excuses are so lame
Real pleas fall on deaf ears
Look away when I'm near
Freezing cold in winter's heat
Burning up can be a treat
Blisters breaking on my feet
At least I get a subway seat
I can't see you
I can't hear you
You don't see me

Self help and preservation
Not now I'm on vacation
Priority is you
And screw all those around you
Now's the time for you to share
Indifference you have to care
Deep inside you know it's true
How do I get through to you
Open your eyes to the horror
Open your eyes to the pain
When you live in a box
No one knows your name

Don't you fuckin' look at me
You know that I am...
One fuckin' well-dressed man!
Now it's dark, but I can see
Don't you fuckin' look at me
Now it's dark, your gonna be
Exactly what I want to see
Now it's dark, Mommy
Don't you fuckin' look at me
A sensation
Of elation
Intoxication
Now it's dark
A candy coated existence
Underneath is decadence
What was hidden you have found
Made it your own battleground
Pretty, pretty don't say please
Don't you fuckin' look at me
You know that I am...
One fuckin' well-dressed man!
Now it's dark, but I can see
Don't you fuckin' look at me
Now it's dark, your gonna be
Exactly what I want to see
Now it's dark, Mommy
Don't you fuckin' look at me
A sensation
Of elation
Intoxication
Now it's dark
I'll send you a love letter
Straight from the bottom of my heart
You'll be fucked forever
The candy coated clown's done his part
I'm your man I'm what you need
Dance with me but never lead
One deep breath will set me free
Don't you fuckin' look at me
You know that I am...
One fuckin' well-dressed man!
[CHORUS]
Don't look at me as a white man
I'm just a man
Don't look at me as a black man
I'm just a man
It takes a man to deal with ignorance
Prove that you can
Like having to climb a barbwire fence
Can ya tell me how it feels to be hated?
Can ya tell me how it feels to be loved?
Can you show me what it
means to be respected?
Or is the answer none of the above?
It's so easy to hate your brother
It should be hard
It's so easy to hate your friends
Why ain't it hard?
Love and hate come in the deck together
Play your card
Love or hate can rule your life forever
Can ya tell me how it feels to be hated?
Can ya tell me how it feels to be loved?
Can you show me what it means to be respected?
Or is the answer none of the above?
Hating, fighting, lying, and I can't take...
Bitching, screwing, crying, and I just hate...
Taking, cheating, spying, and I can't take...
Hating, fighting, dissing, fighting, fighting,
Fighting...
And I can't take no...
SCHISM!
Schism, SK, SK, SK, SCHISM
A house divided can't stand
Prejudice is un-natural thought
When we were kids
It's not inherited, it's taught
When we were kids
If we were blind and had no choice
Differences hid
Would we hate each other by the
tone of our voice?
Can ya tell me how it feels to be hated?
Can ya tell me how it feels to be loved?
Can you show me what it
means to be respected?
Or is the answer none of the above?
Hating, fighting, lying, and I can't take...
Bitching, screwing, crying, and I just hate...
Taking, cheating, spying, and I can't take...
Hating, fighting, dissing, fighting, fighting,
Fighting...
And I can't take no...
SCHISM!
[CHORUS]
I can hear you, I can hear you, lying
I can see you, I can see you, faking
I don't think you're, I don't think
you're, working
I want you to,
I want you to, I want you to...
Write for me, and only me
A really extra special story
Make it mine, every line
Don't make me sorry
It's what I want, It's what I want
And I'll tell you what
You know me, and I can be
A very, very vicious critic
Another fans appreciation
A do-be, don't-be situation
Drag me down into your hatred
Misery loves company
I'm your number one fan
Misery loves company
Misery
Misery loves company
I'm your number one fan
Misery loves company
Die with me
I'll take good care, I'll take great care of you
Listen to me, listen to me you fool
Body and soul, body and soul, you're mine
I want you to,

Write for me, and only me
A really extra special story
Make it mine, every line
Don't make me sorry

And I'll tell you what
You know me, and I'll show you
How to keep your filthy mouth shut

Die with me
Take, take, take, take, another
pound of my flesh
I'm givin' blood
You, you, you, you, should only have the best
I'm givin' blood
What the hell is, what the hell is happening?
I'm the one that made you into the king
Don't turn your back on, turn your back on,
my help
I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I will
I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill...
Write for me, and only me
A really extra special story
Make it mine, every line
Don't make me sorry

Drag me down into your hatred
[CHORUS]
Life can be so wonderful
Real love this time you fool
And then you wake up
And you'd chew off your own arm
Or face the only graduate from Satan's school of charm!
I hear your mama callin' you
I hear your mama callin' you
You'd better stand and face the truth boy
I hear your mama callin' you
I drink three six packs, just so I can look at your face
Finally!
You give respect, you get respect
And you just don't know your place
Finally!
You never learn, you always burn
Now I've got you off of my case
Finally!
I drank three six packs, just so I could look at your face
Finally!
See ya!
Over, finished, gone, done, out!
She's not the one you married
Not the one who cared
Maybe it's her evil twin that's got you by the short hairs
Can you live without it?
Can you be a man?
Can you tell her take a walk and stick it up her can!
I hear your mama callin' you
I hear your mama callin' you
You'd better stand and face the truth boy
I hear your mama callin' you
I drink three six packs, just so I can look at your face
Finally!
You give respect, you get respect
And you just don't know your place
Finally!
You never learn, you always burn
Now I've got you off of my case
Finally!
I drank three six packs, just so I could look at your face
Finally!
See ya!
Over, finished, gone, done, out!
I hear your mama callin' you
I hear your mama callin' you
Now go and pack your bags we're through
I hear your mama callin' you
Rape my mind led down the wrong path
One too many rides and you crashed
Had the looks but had no class
Steal my life and taint my past
Sorry I don't mean to laugh (take it Sam)
How long have you been waiting to be set free?
Don't be a faggot now that's the key
Now I'm free, now I'm free, me me me, finally!!!
Over, finished, gone, done, out!!!!
I was told to love you
I was told to try
I was born to save you
I was born to die
I'll always be your scapegoat
You'll never take the blame
You never had a chance
It was your soul to save
I am your one night nightmare
Pain is all you see
The blood is on your hands
I hope you're proud of me
I was told to love you
I learned how to hate
I was born to save you
Your choice became your fate
You can't take care of yourself
How could you care for me?
I am your retribution
When is my soul free?
I never asked for mercy
You told me to forgive
The blood is on your hands
I hope your proud of me
And what I've done to set you free
I can barely hold myself
Fascination, stimulation, stronger as I learn
By his hand, I understand
I was told to burn
Bastard son, your saving grace
Left alone I found my place
I find love in what I steal
You should of left me rest in Potters Field
I was told to.I was told to...
Your beliefs turned me into this
Bite the hand that feeds, you're so selfish
Thank you mother for giving me this life
I'll bring down the rapture
Then we'll see who lies
Everything is perfect
Everything is sick, that's it
You can't tell me to stop it
You can't tell me not to quit, that's it
Revolve around yourself
It's you and no one else
Hard for me to stay
Swinging moods that change
From calmness to deranged
Unpredictable, unpredictable
You would see if
Only
You hadn't taken things out of my hands
Only
You never wanted to understand
Classing ways to live here
Compromise for me
I'm at both ends of the spectrum
You're somewhere in the between
Ah, come clean
Crucified, terrified, sacrifice, my whole life
If only...
I can't contain myself
I can't contain myself
I just can't take myself
Fix the mental, as if that changes anything
Your heart is cured now, you're normal once again
One confession, you thought that's all it took
But redemption, doesn't let you off the hook
One of us
Can't erase the past to change who he would be
One of us
On a whim would act, then look for sympathy
Not from me
Hear me say...
One more
Chance to believe in
That you can even the score
One more
Place at the table
Always room for one more
Room for one more
Thing evil, is that just your normal gig
Fueled by hatred, happy as a stuffed pig
You're so lonely, everyone around you reeks
Of indifference, thriving in their apathy
Your schism, my distress
Your failure is my success
Squeezed out, kept me down
What goes around comes around
I can wait you out
Patience is my virtue
Call it payback, call it proper grounds
What goes around always comes around, always comes around
In and out
Try to be
What you see
Anarchy
Everything, everyone, everyman
Rebellion
But you can't make a move
If you win then you lose
Look at me to approve
You're so hard, you're so real
You got nothing
Who laughs last?
A question, not a task
I ask,
What's your reason,
Do you believe in anything?
I don't wanna how you're so driven
I don't wanna know your influence
I don't need to prove myself
I just need to be myself
It doesn't show how I'm trying to be
It just shows who I am
Gone,
Take your packaged rebellion
Move on,
Revolution on your sleeve
If you say, mean it
If you mean it, do it
You can't live your life through me
Gone,
Take your packaged Rebellion
With the air you breathe
Look around
No one cares
Who you are
Why or where
You're so blind, you're so dumb, you're so deaf
Like a gun
That you can't even shoot
To the point that is moot
And you don't have a clue
You're so hard, you're so real
You got nothing
Who laughs last?
A question, not a task
I ask,
What's your reason,
Do you believe in anything?
I don't wanna hear how you're so driven
I don't wanna know your influence
I don't need to prove myself
I just need to be myself
It doesn't show who I am trying to be
It just shows who I am
Gone,
Take your packaged rebellion
Move on,
Revolution on your sleeve
If you say it, mean it
If you mean it, do it
You can't live your life through me
If you do it, live it
If you live it, say it
Action is the air you breathe
I saw your act, it came and went
As flaccid as an ex-president
Your ideas are out of place
It's anarchy with a friendly face
Rebel, rebel, don't regret
Screw 'em every chance you get
I...
Who, what, where, when, why,
How many ways can you lie
How many ways can you try
How many ways can you die
What am I gonna do
I can't look at you
What are you gonna do
You're no hypocrite
I bash my head against a wall everyday
You'd bash your head against a wall anyway
And then you took a look to see if I care
But I can't, and I never did
What'd you expect me to give
You never deserved my respect
How many ways can you try
It burns a hole inside my mind
What am I gonna do
I can't look at you
Can't look like you
I'm no hypocrite
What are you gonna do
You love to look at you
Don't have a clue
You're no hypocrite
You've got a hole inside that you have to feed
You've got a hole you'll use to get what you need
And then you took a look to see if I care
But I can't, and I never did
What'd you expect me to give
You never deserved my respect
You've got that look I wanna know
You've got that look, the hy pro glo
I'm wiping the slate spotless
I vow this is your final chance
Almost all but little faith has been thrown out the window
I promise to sustain my stance
You've taken everything from the get go
And you've given nothing in return
Your sado-masochism has reached the ninth inning
Still you're puzzled to see I'm concerned
Struggling, to come to terms with
This god-awful life that I live
Stumbling, but still I try
To get out from under your grip
Transparent in critical moments
You drop me when your hands aren't full
You call yourself my closest friend
Then you make yourself invisible
My simmering blood is rising
Primed and ready to explode
Get off your high horse and come to the party
I'll beat you into overload
Only through your limited viewpoint
You think you know how I exist
Easy to turn my back on the system
Hard not to be an atheist
Back in the days when promises were made
Equality for all
You go by the word from the man who gives it
Never expecting a fall
Struggling, to come to terms with
This god-awful life that I live
Stumbling, but still I try
To get out from under your grip
Transparent in critical moments
You drop me when your hands aren't full
You call yourself my closest friend
Then you make yourself invisible
Transparent in critical moments
You drop me when your hands aren't full
You call yourself my closest friend
Then you make yourself invisible
Make yourself invisible, make yourself invisible
Make yourself invisible, make yourself invisible again
Burn...
I never should've trusted
I never should've trusted
I'm sickened and disgusted
I never should've trusted
What happened to me?
I hate you and you hate me
I cannot not look at you and breathe
So full of hate that I can't see
My funny vibe is hard to miss
Your ignorance can't be called bliss
I have to wash my hands of this
My mind has never been so clear
My hate for you, is one to fear
Take a good look what do you see
No friend to me, Jealously
(It's me) I know how to hurt myself
It's me that makes you hate me
It's me that tries to break free
(It's me) I know how to hurt you
It's me that makes a move
With what I say and what I do
You walk through life deaf, dumb and blind
But when it calls you'll have to find
Why must we all be so unkind
I can't believe it's come to this
The marks I make you can't dismiss
I have to wash my hands of this
Me, you, who is gonna get it
And you can't let it
Drive you to insanity
Me, you, who is gonna take it
When all this hate explodes
When all this hate starts to explode
Deal with the hate inside
That causes you the pain inside
That turns into the rage inside
That makes you feel like death inside
Worship the ground you barely walk on
You give of yourself but your angels are gone
Deny your body is screaming
But your heart and your soul they're bleeding
Just to fall asleep is a godsend
Until your demons appear again
I am a witness to your demise
Your biggest secret is one you can't keep
Lift up your head if you're only asleep
You try to hold onto reason
Why can't you see that you're leaving
My love for you knows no distance
But it can't fight your resistance
I am a witness to your demise
I am the one who saw through the lies
Give me,
The one thing you can't give
Take me to
The black lodge where you live
Deny your body is screaming
But your heart and your soul they're bleeding
Just to fall asleep is a godsend
Until your demons appear again
I am a witness to your demise
I am the one who saw through the lies
My love has always been blind
If one day you'd backed up a promise you made
We'd have to make it a holiday
'Cause we both know that day would never come again
If one day your word was as good as gold
It'd be too late cos I'd be too old
I don't think a human being could live that long
I never gave a damn
I was never even a fan
The only thing that makes me smile if your pain
I don't even care
When did you treat anyone fair?
To say I'm not enjoying this would be insane
Sodium Pentathol was an idea I had
But what does the truth mean now
To all the lost souls you've grabbed
A mass delusion, there's no confusion
Just a hypocrite
Who'd never cop to it
You're in total control and you're still a liar
I can't drink from the cup
I question your authority
You gotta 'fess up
You're in total control and your faith is tired
I can't drink from the cup
Where is truth in the trinity
You gotta 'fess up
If the affects you it's hard to tell
You spent too many cold days in your cell
Never been one to admit that something, might be wrong
I never gave a damn
I was never even a fan
The only thing that makes me smile is your pain
If I ever had the chance
I'd kick out your chair just to watch you dance
Irrelevant, your vanity prevents change
Sodium Pentathol still sounds great to me
An imitation of life buried in theology
Cop to it
You're in total control and you're still a liar
You're in total control and your faith is still
I can't drink from the cup
'Fess up
How much does an opinion weigh
Does it really matter what I say
I can't be responsible
Be yourself or be a tool
Who cares what you expect
What is politically correct?
All my ideas are in bad taste
Get off my case and...
Judge yourself
No one else
I don't intend to offend
I just offend with my intent
Beauty's in the beholder's eye
I just like the ugly side
See things the way I do
Walk a mile in my shoes
Don't assume and damn it, don't praise me
My thoughts would drive you crazy
See things the way I do
Walk a mile in my shoes
Don't assume and damn it, don't praise me
My thoughts would drive you crazy
Kill someone, save a life
Don't do drugs, drink all night
Worship Jesus, praise Satan
Opinions are all contradiction
It's not a case of wrong and right
You may hate what I may like
Vice versa, it's the same
Just do it, no pain no gain
I know I'll never be free
Change doesn't come easy
And if I'll never be free
You'll live in hell with me
Fear, a contradiction
Co-existence, darkness brought to light
My own skin don't seem to fit me right
Pain is my way, of self expression
A fatal choice that always hangs above
Love what I kill, kill what I love
I run, you run, you stop and then you take it
I run, you run, I stop and then you get it
I run, you run, you stop and then you take it
I run, you run, I stop and then you get it
From me,
The one who's giant steps ahead of where you'd be
What you don't see
I know I'll never save myself
Dying from this immortality
This is not an exit
I can never change it
This is not an exit
It's no way
Out, out of touch with
Mortal thoughts, humanity's a dream
Things are not what they seem
Hungry for you, but not to hurt you
Hunger for the secret of your life
I'm a timeless clock and you kill time
This is not an exit
I can never change it
You stop and then you take it
I stop and I can't fake it
This is not an exit
Pain is my way of self expression
A fatal choice hangs above
Love what I kill, kill what I love
Love...
This is not an exit
This is not an exit
I can never change it
This is not an exit
Hand over fist
Come and taste my dark trick
Hand over fist
Kill you when I give it
This is not an exit
This is not an exit
I can never change it
(Balder) Nightmares
Demons haunt my taunted mind
I'm scared
My death's forseen ungloryful
Plase Father
Make my demons disappear
Please Mother
Death is everywhere
(Odin) My son I've seen your fear
I have felt your pain
No harm will come to you
An oath has been sworn
(Balder) The evil forces around us
Still wants to destroy me
Who is the evil slayer
I cannot see
Loke the deceitful God
Discover the arrow of death
Pointed for the Hoder the blind
by the jealous Loke
The arrow cut through the skin
And into the heart of the bright one
Silence spread throughout the hall Aesir
As the God of Light fe to his knees dying!
Sorrow throughout the nine worlds
The bright God is gone
Sent to Nifelheim by the deceitful...
The bleak fimbul winter arrived
Raging across the world
With a fury that defied the memory of man
Terrible wars where fought,
the like had never been seen
Men slew without a thought
The ties of kinship were no more
Skoll and Hati, the ravenous wolves
Arose and devoured the sun and the moon
Darkness descended upon the earth
And the stars fell from the skies
Loud blows heimdall the horne's in the air
Odin quests the head of Mim
Now shakes the holy ash where it stands
The ancient tree moans, Fenris breaks free
How are the Aesir?
How are the Alves?
Loud sounds Joutunheim
Aesir comprise
By the stonedoors dwarfs are moaning
The mountains wise men
Know you now or not?
With his shield at hand
Hrym travels from the east
The serpant is turning, enormous in rage
The serpant breaks the waves
The eagle screams
Nidhoggs tearing corpses
Free comes Nagelfar
Loke leads the legions of the dead
In holy war
Against the justice made by Aesir
Surtur comes from the south
With red hot fire wargods swords
shines like the sun
Mountains breaks, men on hel-road
The heaven crumbles, Ragnarok is at hand
Then to Hlin appears
Another grief when Odin goes to fight
The evil Fenris
And the brave and glory Frey
goes against Surtur
Then will Friggs beloved one die
Vidar,Odin's mighty son,
he will come to slay the wolf
The sword runs into the
heart of Hverdrungs son
So he avenges his father
So comes Llodyns noble son
Thor he goes to fight the snake
In anger he slays the guardian of Midgaard
Nine steps dying walks Odin's son
Away from the snake who misdeeds not fear
Dying from it venom
When all are gone
Only Surtur remained
Passing his hand of fire
across the whole world
Consuming all of creation
[Music/Lyrics: Amon Amarth]
A battle on a distant shore
Seawolves' wrath sweeps the land
Down from the sky Valkyries ride
And walk the field, hallowed by Tyr
The fight is hard, axes swung
Swords bite sharp, men are slain
The ground turns red, blood-soaked field
Dead man's last bed and Oden sees
Vikings fall, in blood they lie
The web of Horns
They've met their fate
With shield and sword
They're brought in pride
To mighty doors of the Speargod's hall
The gates open and into the hall of braves
They silently walk
The one-eyed sits in glory might
Raises his cup and says:
"Pl vida faltet
Harman svingat
Det blankat svardet
Oeh banen mott
Till den hoges sal
De i ara forts
Oeh vid mjodet hor
Oden kvada"
Dawn breaks. The Einherjer goes to
Relive their last fight
With passion, swords held high
As they ride in the morning mist
The sun warms the air
War cries sound
"Tor Hjelpe!"
The battle begins
Charging horses with fire in breath
Rush to battle - in glory die!
Swords sing in joy
Again they cut
With shining edges
Blood-stained steel
Axes shine, again they're swung
Ripping flesh - death be done
The cold night comes
With charging darkness
To Oden's hall
The Einherjer return
A feast awaits until the next day
When warriors' eyes again shall burn
[Music/Lyrics: Amon Amarth]
Grey clouds - cover the winter sky
Cold snow - falls like autumn leaves to the ground
The icy wind
Pierces the skin of waiting warriors
Like spears
Will pierce their bodies in battle
Frosted
Beards on pale grey faces
Eyes of death
Are burning with rage
Glancing across the fields of Tyr
In the early morning light
Grey clouds - cover the winter sky
Cold snow - falls like autumn leaves to the ground
The icy wind
Pierces the skin of waiting warriors
Like spears
Will pierce their bodies in battle
War cries break the silent wait
Charging warriors rush to kill
Swords are swung in the air
The gods of war are called
Vikings with fire in soul
Clash on the open field
Slaying with powerful strokes
The snow is turning red
Hooves gallop the plains
Warlords on horsebacks
Ride into battle
With a thunderous roar
The storm wind of death
Blows across the field
Sweeping with it
Everything in its way
So the battle settles
Alone stands just one man
Under the grey-clouded winter sky - alone. . .
As his life's blood leaving
I hold my son, my only son
And tears fill my burning eyes
While his skin turns pale as snow
Butchered he lies here bleeding in my arms
Slewn by the men of the single god
Hatred burns in my chest
Rain falls from a raging heaven
The wind howls like wolves at the moon
I will seek my vengeance for my son
I swear I'll avenge my first born one
I ride fast through the woods
My friends are by my side
Dark hatred burns in my eyes
"Slaves of hvitekrist today you die!"
"Mäktiga gudar,
i gyllene salen.
Hjälp mig i striden
mot sondräparna,
Den höge skall
för huggen hämnas
och blod skall gäldas
i blod"
Our cloaks fly in the wind
As we ride in the cold dark night
We're closing in our enemies
We rage in our hearts burning bright
The clouds scatter in the northern wind
A full moon rides the pitch black sky
"Now, hounds of Hvitekrist,
your time has come to die!"
"Kneel before my sword!
No mercy! Your time has come to die!
This is the ride for vengeance!"
Alone he stands in the doorway
His family still asleep
Gazing at the starlit horizon
And the moonsparkling sea
When dawn comes he must leave them
His home, his children and loved
For his destiny beyond those waves
Known only to the Norns
He's already dressed ready to leave
His four friends are waiting by the shore
Each with a dragon ship
And one hundred men prepared for war
He returns to his bed kissing
His sleeping wife goodbye
And as he leaves his youngest son
A tear rolls from his eye
They set sail with the first morning rays
Heading for glorious wars
And as the five ships steer out from the bay
Their hearts pound like never before
The wind is strong, the sun is warm
Their Dragons fly across the waves
No greenfaces are seen here onboard
Only a crowd of braves
Many nights pass
And days long as a year
They await the battle
They await without fear
On the morning of the fifth day
Before the sun arose
They hear bells chime and see pyres
Torched at a nearby coast
"LOWER THE SAIL, GRAB YOUR OARS,
NOW MEN IT'S TIME TO ACT!
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO THE SHORE,
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO ATTACK!"
I see
Without fear my destiny
As the raging skies begins to fade
Pouring rain
Licks my wounds as my blood flows
From my torn flesh!
As I die
I hold my sword
My only friend
And pray that Oden
Will take me home
The battle rages
But I hear only raindrops falling
Like in slow motion to the ground
Death release me
Free me from my earthly pain
Oden I ask thee please
Take me home
Without fear I die!
As I look
To the sky the heaven is lit
And Valkyries in shining armour
Descend
I rest my head
On the ground
And close my eyes
I know that Oden's sent for me
As I die
Without fear I die
I close my eyes
And die
Without fear
Ten heavy feet
Walk the bloodsoiled ground
With rhythm these
Five warriors march
No matter how much
The bleeding wounds
From enemy swordcuts
Hurt to the bone
The revenge they sought
Was taken in blood
No mercy was showed
No mercy was showed
They ignore the pain
That hammerlike pounds
From falls, off slain horses,
To the ground
No signs of weakness
No signs of weariness
Not even a glimpse
Of remorse in their eyes
They slew men ruthless
Fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave
This land side by side
Now they're headed home
Five swordsmen who fought repentlessly
Their story will be told
Of five brave men endlessly
All sorrow is left
For the women to bare
The children cries
They live in fear
No man was spared
No house or farm remains
No christian woman unraped
Their church consumed by flames
Their steel shines red
With enemy blood
It sings of victory
Granted by the Gods
And as they return
Bleeding but proud
The horizon burns
And the song is ringing loud
Salt water licks my face
and wind fills the sail
We head for wars on distant shores
My friends are all with me
And so they'll always be
We'll never bend untill the end
We cross the open waves
On course to far off lands
Thor guides our ships
With his strong hands
Across the waves our seasnakes fly
Carried like ravens in the sky
By heavens breath on wings of death
Blood will run red
As we sever bodies from their heads
We maim and kill by pure will
We hail our Gods
Sacrifice in blood
Our altar is the battlefields
Death is something we don't fear
Though it's always near
Ygg brings us home when time has come
We are five of us
Friends of the suncross
Strong and brave to the grave!
They came riding down the slopes
Five fearless men prepared to fight
We heard with fear the rumbling earth
In the mid-day light
Surprised we saw all terrified
The brave northmen's run
The fearless five with power ride
Attacking us in the mid-day sun
Their charge was fast, no alarm was sound
They broke right through our lines
I felt the cut it threw me to the ground
And now I feel has come my time
I lie here in my blood
And see my family get killed
I feel abandoned by my god
I fear death's chill
I see Hel's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I don't want to die
Oh no! I was wrong
Denied the true gods
And now I'm doomed
I trusted foreign men
And their god's son
But now when I need them
They are gone
I see Hel's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I die!
They ride across the planes
And punish those of false belief
All resistance is in vain
As they caress them with cold steel
They are the punishers
And they will never bend
They are power the five of them
From Asgard they are sent
The power they have in all they do
The Christians non will feel
No one can escape them no
They will make them kneel
Their fight is through, they must return
No one here survived
And as the blood red sky begins to burn
To Valhall they will ride
A storm rolls in from the sea
Covering the land with black thunder clouds
Rain whips the ground at their feet
As they come ashore in this foreign land
Thunder brakes the silence
Of fivehundred men assembled ashore
Gazing through the misty rain
At the mountain not a mile away
So dark and silent it stands there
The mighty AMON AMARTH
Reaching for the cloudcloked skies
So grim and fearful in might
With the wind in their backs they start walking
Decisive men of the north
They strive through this darkened land
With only mount doom in their sight
The closer they get to the mountain
The clearer their eyes can see
A forest of one thousand spears awaiting
Awaiting the battle that will be
A cry of war emerges
Echoes over the field
Warriors run, like wolves up the sloaps
Boldley charging the enemy lines
With weapons so fearsome and sharp in their hands
And shields of oakwood and steel
They slit open stomachs and split skulls to the jaw
Intestants cover the field
The defenders are weak in this brutal war
The northmen have power and guts
A bloodshed like no one has seen here before
None can escape their cuts
Arrows with fire fly through the air
Touching houses and shields
The Vikings can feel victory is near
As the enemy headlessly flees
A gust of wind blows in from the north
Clearing the clouds away
As twilight falls and the stars come forth
And the seawolves return to the bay
Corpses lie scattered all over the field
For the ravens to eat as they please
The mountain is now left there behind
As they sail with the first morning breeze
Rumbling thunder cracks the sky
And rain starts pouring down
Lightning strikes a cold bright light
Upon the blooddrenched ground
The sword play is hard
And many fall
Steel bites sharp in flesh
And upon a mountain
Towering tall
Stand the messengers of death
Five horsemen in armour bright
Waiting in the flashing light
Looking down upon the field
Where Vikings fight with axe and shield
On stallions black as night
With eyes burning red
They ride with thunder to the fight
Deliverance of certain death
A warcry loud as Heimdall's horne
Echoes across the land
Enemies who hear it freeze to the bone
Friends of doom proudly stand
They ride faster than the wind
With lightning speed they strike
Black ravens follow where they've been
To feed from those who died
With power they wield their swords
As they ride down fleeing men
Sending them to Hel's dark court
To never come back again
The warriors ride once more
To the mountain from which they came
Once sent by the gods to war
And they never return in shame
Bastards of a lying breed
You've ruled us for too long
Truth to you are lies to me
And your right is so wrong
Moral preached by immoral fucks
All I feel is despise
Lie no more you fucking cunts
You tare me up inside
Your sons die from your abuse
But you're giving us the blame
The easy path's the one you choose
That road will lead to pain
You're trying to control their mind
And strip them of free will
They way you force them to go blind
Will surely get them killed
My mind is free and so is my soul
You can't put me in chains
I won't play the well-adjusted role
Or bow my head in shame
So throw your stones of guilt at me
Point your finger, Curse my name!
Your scapegoat I will never be
I won't take the blame!
Now we're on trial to serve your crime
And pay for your mistakes
There is no way we'll do the time
The chains of lies will break
Censorship can't stop our truth
We speak straight from the heart
There is nothing you can do
We'll tare your souls apart
So see us rise we're few but strong
We'll crack your fucking teeth
And feed you with your twisted tongue
Until you cannot breathe
The fury makes our eyes see red
It burns within our hearts
Soon you'll all be stone cold dead
We'll tare your souls apart!
STRIKE!
Fast and hard, show no mercy for these men
The vermin of Christ, prophets of lies and their disciples
Seek them out, hunt them down
Break their spirits, crush their hearts
Not even death will set them free from this pain
CHARGE!
Ride them down as they flee from our steel
Draw their blood, make them suffer
Before they die by war-field sacrifice
Wipe them out! Burn their homes and fields
Feed the wolves with their offspring, annihilate them all!
Masters of War, torment every soul
Rape every whore that carries the cross
FIRE!
Burn them all, burn them alive
Send their souls to Deathqueen's hall
To the land of cold burning flames
Send them to the land of famine and despair
Eternally they will starve and freeze
He's running through the woods so black
A loyal servant of Christ
Dogs are barking down his back
He's running for his life
He came with words of love and peace
These heathens had to be saved
He thought that he could make them see
Instead he was enslaved
In captivity he spoke of god
To all he met he preached
But when his master's patience ran out
He knew he had to flee
Tears are running down his cheeks
As he sobbign realizes
That in this land his god is weak
And today he's going to die
He stumbles out onto an open field
Where an old oak tree grows
In the branches hang men of three
Dressed in preacher robes
His knees refuse to carry him on
Terror shines in his eyes
His faith in Christ is almost gone
His god's left him to die
Below the dead he says his prayers
To the god he thought was alive
When he hears a calm voice say:
"SHUT HIM UP AND HANG HIM HIGH!"
As his breath leaves his eyes open wide
A bright light comes from above
He greets this light with a smile
And thinks: "There is a God"
The sound of eight hooves reaches his ears
Comes from the heavenly light
Two wolves' howls fill his heart with fear
And he sees two ravens fly
Down from the sky a warlord rides
Like fire his one eye glows
And just before the preacher dies
He knows his god is false
Risen from the sea
The beast of hell is here
He's come to rule the earth
Kneel and obey his power
A second beast rises
Rises from the earth
Followed by an army
An army of immortals
An army of the dead
Second beast breaks from the earth
Kneel and obey his power
Fire in the rocks
Fire from the sky
Kneel and obey
Kneel or die!!
Kneel or die!!
There is wisdom with him
Who hath understanding reckon
The number of the beast for it is
A number of a man its number
He's risen from the sea
The beasts of hell are here
Come to rule the world
And you will be in fire
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
Men will fight and men will die
Wars will be lost and won
That's how it's been and still will be
Long after I'm gone
Doubting not I give my blood
So I may enter hall up high
The sky belongs to Asagods
As long as the raven flies
Death is drawing near
I know it's true but I have no fear
I know I can't escape my:
FATE! Turns it's deadly wheel
Judgement day is closing in but still I cannot feel:
REMORSE! Is for the weak
I stand silent while they speak, their accusations are all:
LIES! Spread by preaching men
I'm on trial for being who I am
And praising the Gods of my native land
I will stand firm, I refuse to kneel
The fury in me is divine
My dark grave awaits, my fate is revealed
But I'm not afraid to die
Death! The day to die is here
The sun rides high on the northern sphere
And the executioner sharpens his:
Axe! Shines in the sun
I smile when they tie me down
And hear the sound of the falling blade
Death! Sweet death, relieve me from this world
Death! Sweet death, relieve me, relieve:
So death finally came to him
The pagan man could not be turned
He faced death with a grin
Now his head rests in the dust
The proud man stood firm, he refused to kneel
Then fury in him was divine
Now he is dead, his fate has been sealed
He's brought to Golden Hall up high
All is lost and foreign kings
Rule the northern realms
Hammerfest, the last outpost
Has fallen to unbearded men
Lords of the bloody cross
Deceived or murdered all of true faith
Now the temple of Thor, where Mjolner is kept
Is under siege
They fear the power of Mjolner
The hammer of Thor
And all their efforts to destroy it have failed
From deep within the frozen ground
Comes a rumbling sound
Ravens fly and wild wolves howl
Sending shivers down Christians' spines
As if from nowhere
Dark and grim he appears
The warlord of the Gods comes with force
To retrieve The Crusher
The first man died with a gurgling sigh
When his head was crushed
Painful surprise in his eyes
As his life was snuffed
With raw and brutal force
The warlord breaks the temple doors
The weak back off in fear
On the altar it lies, he lifts the hammer high
And before it he swears:
`Allvise Ygg, Maktige Harjafader
Guda av Asars och vaners att
Hor mina ord, nar som jag svar
Att om tusen vintrar ater ta var ratt?
While he speaks his prayer
Mjolner rests in the air
As if holding breath
Frozen by fear
They gathered stand and stare
And what they see is death
A laughing cry fill the shivering night
He lets the hammer strike
A bolt of lightning bright
Rips the darkened sky
Fire of doom - Ignite!
Once I was - Now I am no more
A burst of flames threw me into oblivion
The life I knew - Seems distant and unreal
A fading dream, a memory I can't recall
Am I real - I can no longer tell
A notion tells me I still exist
Infinite dark - Through this void I float
Resting, waiting for the day
When I will live again
Eons pass or maybe I just blinked
Deeper into this hell I sink
Falling through Ginnungagap
I'm pulled towards an unseen gate
I seem to hear my name being called
I float towards these cries of fate
Faster than - the speed of light
I am falling through universe
Stars flash by - Before my eyes
The time has come to return
Out of the dark - Into the light
Back into life I am cast
By my side - A demon army rides
We ride to reclaim that once we lost
Eons have passed, I'm back from the dead
Victory lies ahead
He's riding down 'cross a field familiar but nothing is the same
This place he knew as Hammerfest
When the old Gods reigned
The army of demons rides
By his side with weapons drawn
Today is the day
When Ragnarok will be spawned
There lies the mountain where the temple once stood
Where eons ago he arose to spill their christian blood
Stuck in the rock is a golden ring
That yet no one's dared to touch
The legend has it it's where the Crusher once struck
He pulls the hammer from the mountain's grip
The sign for demons to attack
He's been called upon to arise and he won't spare a single life
No, Thor (won't) spare a single soul, nor let them get away alive
They strike down on the world with overwhelming force
All resistance is brutally crushed, crushed without remorse
Dark angels descend to join the bloodfight
The slaughter brings them on, see Odin's Valkyries ride
The battle of Midgard is almost won
And the thousand years of tyranny will be forever gone
Soon a new world will be born rising from the Sea
Where Asagods again shall reign and humans will be free
He rides once more upon the black mountain of doom
Holding firm the Crusher of giants' bones
He lets the hammer strike, now everything will burn
As Surtur's fire is released upon the world
[Bonus Track]
[originally by Possessed]
Every night I see through eyes
Of a different lunatic
And every night I fantasize
In trancial mesmeric
All alone inside my head
Within my padded cell
Ruled by thoughts of another mind
Controlled by unseen eyes
In my mind I see the sun
Plunge into the sea I listen to my
Tales now I'll tell you what I see
And so the corpses
And the thrill
My mind is warped
Nothing's real
Do I dream
Or is it true
The piercing scream
She never knew
Every night I see through eyes
Of a different lunatic
And every night I fantasize
The eyes of horror
There comes Fenris' twin
His jaws are open wide
The serpent rises from the waves
Jormungandr twists and turns
Mighty in his wrath
The eyes are full of primal hate
Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits
Vingtor rise to face
The snake with hammer high
At the edge of the world
Bolts of lightning fills the air
as Mjölnir does it's work
the dreadfull serpent roars in pain
Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits
Mighty Thor grips the snake
Firmly by its tongue
Lifts his hammer high to strike
Soon his work is done
Vingtor sends the giant snake
Bleeding to the depth
Twilight of the thundergod
Ragnarök awaits
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits
See them gathered on the plains now
See an army strong and vast
As long as one of us remains here
None of them will ever pass
Here they come so raise the shields high
Like wolves they show their teeth
None of us will ever yield now
To the scavengers beneath
We're outnumbered ten to one here
Still, I love the odds
We will sacrifice them one by one
Send them off to the gods
Soon we will be gone
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall die
Here they come ten thousand strong
Charging up the hill
This day will be both hard and long
They move in for the kill
Hold the line don't let it break
Use your sword and spear
A glory death, for all awaits
All who knows no fear
Hordes of men they hit the shields
Like waves they break away
We face our woven destiny
And we don't fear the grave
Soon we will be gone
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall die
Standing firm against all odds
guarding the most sacred home
we protect the realm of gods
our destiny is carved in stone
three evil giants
of the south
are constantly on the attack
with lies and fire
from their mouths
but we always send them back
we are brothers
of the north
who are sharing the all father's blood
marching down the left hand path
we are spawned by Asagods
'cause we are!
we're the guardians
guardians of Asgaard
guardians
guardians of Asgaard
guardians
of Asgaard
we have faced our enemies
a thousand times or even more
still they cannot
make us kneel
one thousand years of constant war
the giants look for
any chance
to bring down Asgaard's mighty walls
no matter what they send at us
we will never let it fall
'cause we are!
We're the guardians
guardians of Asgaard
guardians
guardians of Asgaard
guardians
of Asgaard
Standing firm
against all odds
we are guarding
Asgård's mighty walls
we protect
the realm of Asagods
no matter
what they send at us
we will never
let them fall
We're the guardians
guardians of Asgård
guardians
guardians of Asgård
guardians
guardians of Asgård
guardians
of Asgård
The enemy has come for you
Hear the pounding thunder hooves
There's no time to run or hide
Draw the weapon from your side
When they ride out
From morning mist
With sharp blades in mighty fists
One hundred warriors on horse
An awesome brutal force
You feel weak and scared
Fear has gripped your heart
You will soon be over run
You will soon be torn apart
Now, where is your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care for you?
His silence speaks loud and clean
Raid is done!
See the country burn
All are gone!
Only misery remains
Raid is done!
The warriors return
All are gone!
All that's left is pain
The Vikings strike
So fast and hard
Those who run won't make it far
And those who chose to stand and fight
They have made the choice to die
The weapons tear through flesh and bone
Dying men that scream and moan
With severed limbs
To the hall of death
The battlefield is full of death
Feel the stench of rotting flesh
When the entire country burns
As the warriors return
And they came out
From morning mist
With sharp blades in mighty fists
They leave this land
All burned and scorn
Those alive will mourn
Now, where is your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care for you?
His silence speaks loud and clean
Raid is done!
See the country burn
All are gone!
Only misery remains
Raid is done!
The warriors return
All are gone!
All that's left is pain
Raid is done
See the country burn,
Only misery remains
All are gone
Warriors return,
All that's left is pain
Where's your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care?
Where's your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
A silence loud and clear!
Miklagaard has been our home
For twenty years or more
We've lent our axes, spears and swords
In service of the emperor
We are loyal warriors
That's the oath we gave
To protect the emperor
Even to a violent grave
Our loyalty was always firm
We kept our given word
On these southern battlefields
Our northern war cries roared
Battles have been fought
Many gave their lives
But all who died by axe and sword
Were called to hall up high
Our time here
Is now at end
Can't help but reminisce
A cold spring day
So long ago
When we set out to sea
We!
Set out from Svitjod's
Shores!
With dreams of fame and
Gold!
And!
The work of weaving
Norn's!
Was for us unknown
We were loyal warriors
That's the oath we gave
To protect the emperor
Even to the grave
It's time to take farewell
We have been resolved
From the sacred oath we gave
It's time to go back home
Out time here
Is now at end
Our memories will stay
Of Miklagaard
Our southern home
Until the end of days
We!
Set out for Svitjod's
Shores!
With honor and
Rewards!
We return back
Home!
We return back
Home!
With honor and
Rewards!
We return back
Home!
There comes Lopt, the treacherous
Lusting for revenge
He leads the legions of the dead
Towards the Aesir's realm
They march in full battle dress
With faces grim and pale
Tattered banners and bloody flags
Rusty spears and blades
Cries ring out, loud and harsh
From cracked and broken horns
Long forgotten battle cries
In strange and foreign tongues
Spear and sword clash rhythmically
Against the broken shields they beat
They bring their hate and anarchy
Onto Vigrid's battlefield
There comes Lopt, the treacherous
He stands against the gods
His army grim and ravenous
Lusting for their blood
Nowhere is longer safe
The earth moves under our feet
The great world tree Yggdrasil
Trembles to its roots
Sons of Muspel gird the field
Behind them Midgaard burns
Hrym's horde march from Nifelheim
And the Fenris wolf returns
Heimdal grips the Giallarhorn
He sounds that dreaded note
Oden rides to quest the Norns
But their web is torn
The Aesir rides out to war
With armor shining bright
Followed by the Einherjer
See Valkyries ride
Nowhere is longer safe
The earth moves under our feet
The great world tree Yggdrasil
Trembles to its roots
Sons of Muspel gird the field
Behind them Midgaard burns
Hrym's horde march from Nifelheim
And the Fenris wolf returns
I'm out of breath
And all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes
With every step I take
My heart beats
It's about to burst
This day my luck
Turned to the worse
There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings
Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand
I fought so hard
For taste of victory
The war is lost
But I refuse to kneel
I can't go back now
There is no retreat
I will fight hard for
All that I believe
I'm out of breath
And all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes
With every step I take
I can't go back now
There is no retreat
I will fight 'til death
I make my final charge
I, make my final charge
I; have no fear in heart
I will no longer run
I, do not fear the dark
There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings
Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand
The blade I swing
Is black as night
Black as my soulless heart
It bears the burden
Of many lives
But I don't feel remorse
I lent my sword
To anyone
Willing to pay the price
No regrets for
What I've done
A mercenary's life
But there i was
On battleground
Until I felt the jaws of death
Cut into my flesh
Defending old and weak
But I did not retreat
Now, here I lie
In my own blood
And strangers cry for me
I'm prepared to meet the gods
I wish they'd let me be
I don't deserve
Their sympathy
I know who I am
My soul is death and misery
I am an evil man
I rest in my blood
Soon I will face the gods
Strangers cry for me
I wish they'd let me be
Show no sympathy
Shed no tears for me
I know who I am
I am an evil man
I know who I am
I am an evil man
[featuring Apocalyptica]
The pack of wolves
Are closing in
Now, hear the howling beasts
They move fast
Through winter woods
And soon it's time to feast
A vicious hunt
On through the night
The prey is short of breath
They feel the sting
Of burning eyes
That's fixed upon their necks
A predator's heart
Knows no remorse
It lives for the hunt
A predator's heart
Knows no remorse
It lives for the hunt
A natural force
They show their sharp
And grinning teeth
As howls are getting higher
Sending chills
Down fleeing spines
Their blood runs hot as fire
The vicious chase
Is soon at end
They're hunted until death
They feel the pain
Of sharpening steel
That's cutting through their flesh
Fearless warriors
Feed the wolves
Now hear the howling beasts
They move fast
Through winter woods
See the grey-backs feast
A natural force
It knows no remorse
And lives for the kill
I stroke the blade with my hand
the sharp edge cuts the skin
blood drips to the rain wet sand
my journey can begin
Once a slave but now I'm free
my honor is restored
once again I'll ride the seas
free at last from whip and oar
I slide the sword into the sheath
the ocean god is hailed
and as we push out to the sea
we raise the red striped sails
I've missed the breeze of my home shores
the frozen lakes and winter snow
but now my dreams start to unfold
father, I'm coming home
The storm came down without remorse
and water crashed the rails
the ship was thrown back and forth
as strong winds ripped the sails
The icy waves embrace my skin
I am going numb
The endless ocean swallows me
This will be my cold wet tomb
Won't feel the breeze of my home shore
nor see the lakes or winter snow
my hopeful dreams lie ripped and torn
father, I die alone
War, the very first war of our world,
When the treacherous witch was killed
Three times burned and three times born,
By searing flames was Gullveig torn.
Death, Odin hurled his spear off with great force
Deep into the great vana-fyrd
battle horns gave up their sound
And Asgard walls razed to the ground.
The Vanir felt deceived
Hœnir was a fool
without Mímir at his side
Hœnir could not rule
In a fit of violent rage
Mímir's blood was shed
and to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head
Truce, so a brittle and frail peace was forged
And to ensure that the peace remained.
Njordr and Freyr to Asgard came
and Hön' and Mim to Vanaheim
Death, see the furious gods wanting blood,
Odin knew that a raging war
would not bring them any gain
Just leave a black and bitter stain.
Odin tog huvudet och
smorde det med örter
som hindrar det
från att ruttna
han kvad sedan
trollsånger över det
så att Mimer åter
kunde tala till honom
[English translation:]
Odin took the head, and anointed it with herbs
which prevents it from rotting
he sang his magic songs over it
so that Mimer be able to speak to him
The Vanir felt deceived
Hœnir was a fool
without Mímir at his side
Hœnir could not rule
In a fit of violent rage
Mímir's blood was shed
and to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head
You come to me, eyes full of grief
you ask of me to shed all my tears
to let him return from kingdom of fears
Why should I weep? or lose any sleep?
He never brought me pleasure or glee
so why would I help to set Balder free
You come to me,eyes full of grief
all of your tears mean nothing to me
so why will you not just leave me to be
am I to blame? Well, I'm not ashamed!
Oh how I smiled when I heard the tale
Of Loke the sly, so clever and brave
Höder the fool,Lopt's willing tool
he held the twig that cut Balder's skin
Lopt aimed the shot
that killed Höder's twin
leave me alone
don't come here and moan
I've never wished to see Balder's well
so let his soul remain down in hel
My name is Töck and I won't cry
I won't let Balder return
Let hel keep her treasured prize
let his soul forever burn
You come to me and cannot believe
that this old crow now talking to you
is Loke not Töck you bloody dawn fools
you come to me and you do not see
all of your tears mean nothing to me
why will you not just leave me to be
[solo: Mikkonen]
My name is Töck,and I won't cry
I won't let Balder return
Let hel keep her treasured prize
let his soul forever burn
I rise up from muspelheim
My fury is sublime
The sword I bring burns violently
With wild and lethal flames
I march against the asagods
To bring the end of time
I am pure and endless pain
And Surtur is my name
See me rise, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Bringer of flames and endless hurt
Scorcher of men and earth
[Solo: Södenberg]
Swordless frej with horn in hand
Rises to his final stand
He doesn't stand a single chance
I'll split his living corpse in half
And yet he stabbed me in the eye
He drove the horn in deep
The overwhelming, raging pain
Is driving me insane
The waves of flames that
I've unleashed will eat us all alive
The rage that burns within my heart
Is uncontrolled and wild
And now everything shall die!
Massive waves consume us all, the ocean is released
Our dying world quakes underneath
And sinks into the sea
And now nothing will survive!
Extinction waits for everyone
For gods and men alike
When all are gone of the old world
A new one will arise
[Solo: Södenberg]
See me rise, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Bringer of flames and endless hurt
Scorcher of men and earth
See me die, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Drowning in waves that floods the earth
The beginning, of a new rebirth
They speak of love and tolerance
They thrive on people's ignorance
To make you all slaves of fear
They feed on your anxiety
To build their dead society
They've kept you down for a thousand years
They nurture prejudice and hate
Condemn the wars that they create
In the name of whatever god
They gladly sacrifice your lives
Increasing power is their prize
Without regrets they'll spill your blood
They're feeding you lies
With calculating smiles
Enslavement of the human mind
As long as you kneel to their authority
Religion is what makes you blind
They're treating you as mindless fools
And use you as obedient tools
It's time to set your spirit free
This world we cannot tolerate
It's time to seal all preachers' fate
And let them hang from Oden's tree
Your minds are restrained
Obedience is the chain
They've locked you up and thrown away the key
Your souls are for sale,
And you're the ones who pay
But still you'll never be set free
They're feeding you lies
With calculating smiles
Enslavement of the human mind
As long as you kneel to their authority
Religion is what makes you blind
From birth we're taught how to survive
We're taught how war is waged
And there are no men now alive
Who stops our wild rampage
Light at heart we bide our bane
whatever death awaits!
Norsemen live without regrets
We accept our woven fates
So fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate
Don't despair, show no fear
Live your life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death
A coward thinks he'll always live
If it keeps himself from strife
Old age leaves no rest and peace
though spears may spare his life
We don't mourn a friend that fell
or dread the day we'll fall ourselves
Warriors don't go to Hel
'cause we know Ygg will greet us well!
Fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate
Don't despair, show no fear
Live your life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death
So raise your horns to those who died
Let's drink to fallen friends tonight
Let's celebrate their glory life
We'll meet again in Valhall when we die
When we die!
When we die!
See him rise, from land of flames
our destruction is at hand.
It is time to make stand
now I face, and awesome foe
I will always stand my ground
To this end my fate is bound!
This fight is mine and mine alone
and there's no help from anyone!
His wrath burns!
With insane heat
all his fury is unleashed
there is no way to defeat!
The forces and the power that he wields
My hand holds the horn so firm
I am calm and ready to die
Everything around me burns
And I know that I will not survive
See him rise from land of flames
in this wild and barren land
I will make my final stand
My death awaits, I have no fear
To this end my fate is bound
though I'm doomed
I'll stand my ground!
This fight is mine and mine alone
and there's no help from anyone!
[Solo: Simon Solomon]
I go forth to meet my doom
but I will die in vain
perdition waits for everyone
The world will die in flames
With all my strength I run the horn
deep into his eye
And as he swings his burning sword
I die with a tired smile!
[Solo: Simon Solomon]
Time!
has come to wash our shame away
to erase the image of defeat
We!
have licked our wounds,restored our strength
and our vengeance will be oh so sweet
They thought they had us down
that we'd never rise again
they will learn that they were deadly wrong
what's owed will be repaid
Again we'll feed the wolves
and then vengeance will be ours
we'll split their skulls and spill their guts
upon the frozen ground
Yeah,we'll never kneel again
not to deity nor men
now they'll taste our bitter hate
what's owed will be repaid
So raise the flag once more
and the eagle will be fed
once again we march to war
for victory or death
They arrived with talk of hvitekrist
by force they wanted us to kneel
with their swords held to our throats they preached
but we will make them pay we'll take their lives away
[solo: Mikkonen]
So Raise!
raise the flag once more
in the east the eagle will be fed
March!
again we march to war
we will march for victory or death
Pain!
the pain and suffering
is but a bleak and distant fading dream
Shame!
our disgrace; a withering thought
finally our names will be redeemed
My head hurts like hell
Can't open my eyes
My clothes are all wet
And I'm freezing right through
Don't know where I am
Or how to get home
My arms they're so numb
And it's hard to get up
My muscles they ache
With every move
I stand on my feet
But my knees feel so weak
[Chorus:]
Somebody wake me
From this horrible dream
Somebody save me
From this terror I feel
[Solo: Söderberg]
I stumble around
on the soft muddy ground
I call out the name
of the friends I can't find
but only the wind
And the ravens reply
With every gasp
with every breath
smoke fills my lungs
and my intestines wrench
With every gasp
the sweet taste of death
The air is full of a thick
pungent stench
[Solo: Söderberg]
So comes then rain
it's colder than ice
I wash off my face
and open my eyes
And then I see
but wish I were blind
They are all dead
there's blood everywhere
The Norsemen they left
only death and despair
A stench of flesh
that fills the Autumn air
[Chorus:]
Somebody wake me
From this horrible dream
Somebody save me
From this terror and pain
No one can save me
From this horrible dream
No one can hear me
Or my heart-wrenching screams
Conceived was I
From chaos and hate
Of malice, deceit and blood
And how would they know
My fate is to rise
Against the Asagods
My being is full, full of a rage
An evil that can't be tamed
It darkens my soul
And blackens the blood
A fire that fills my veins
So how
Did I ever end up here?
Humiliated, broken and weak
I've waited
For a thousand years
To break these chains apart and
To finally break myself free
I bit the hand, off the mighty Tyr
When I couldn't, tare my ties
Now banished I dwell
A sword in my jaw
awaiting the end of time
In darkness I drown
Consumed by my hate
Longing for revenge
Allfather will pay
For his deceit
At the battle
Of Ragnarök
A beast am I
So vicious and grim
They fear my mean
Grinning teeth
I bide my time
my sweet revenge
Soon my ties will fall
And finally I will be free
So when you hear me howling
You'll know that I have come for you
When you hear me call your name
Your life will end in nameless pain
[Solo: Simon Solomon]
Conceived was I
From chaos and hate
Of malice, deceit and blood
And how would they know
My fate is to rise
Against the Asagods
My being is full, full of a rage
An evil that can't be tamed
It darkens my soul
And blackens the blood
A fire that fills my veins
A beast am I
So vicious and grim
They fear my mean
Grinning teeth
I bide my time
my sweet revenge
Soon my ties will fall
And finally I will be!
Finally break myself!
Finally I will be free!
The autumn clouds are caving in
And night comes crawling, black as sin
Lightning strikes, and rain begins
A storm that tears my soul
I toss and tumble in my bed
My thoughts are spinning in my head
Darkness nears, soon I'll be dead
I'm losing all control
I've spent my life in foolish quests
for gold and riches, I confess
And now I'm left with just regrets
Too late to change my ways
My life, it seems, has slipped away
I leave no legacy to praise
Nothing more for me to say
My life has been a waste
When!
My time has come for me to leave
When!
When judgment's passed upon my life
When!
A cold dark grave will wait for me
Will!
Will my name live endlessly?
When!
My time has come for me to leave
When!
When judgment's passed upon my life
When!
A cold dark grave will wait for me
Will!
Will my name live endlessly?
So I die
But won't be mourned
Broken and alone
I wish that I were never born
So I die and won't be missed
No rune stone will be raised
As my body rots away
Die!
All friends and cattle pass away
Die!
And death will come for every man
Die!
But I know one thing never dies
Doom!
The sentence passed upon the dead
Now!
The time has come for me to leave
Now!
When judgement's passed up on my life
Now!
Now I will rest in my dark grave
Will!
They speak my name with reverence?
My life has been a waste
No rune stone will be raised
So I die, but won't be mourned
I wish that I were never born
I rest here in my shallow grave
As my body rots away
[Bonus track]
[System Of A Down cover]
Life is a waterfall
we're one in the river
and one again after the fall
swimming through the void
we hear the word
we lose ourselves
but we find it all....
cause we are the ones that want to play
always want to go
but you never want to stay
and we are the ones that want to choose
always want to play
but you never want to lose
aerials, in the sky
when you lose small mind
you free your life
life is a waterfall
we drink from the river
then we turn around and put up our walls
swimming through the void
we hear the word
we lose ourselves
but we find it all...
cause we are the ones that want to play
always want to go
but you never want to stay
and we are the ones that want to choose
always want to play
but you never want to lose
aerials, in the sky
when you lose small mind
you free your life
aerials, so up high
when you free your eyes eternal prize
aerials, in the sky
when you lose small mind
you free your life
aerials, so up high
when you free your eyes eternal prize
Since I was born they have kept me down,
They have forced me to conform.
I will tear down their holy crown in a vengeful thunder storm,
I loathe their bloody righteous ways
It fills me with despise,
Fuelling flames of violent rage,
I will be their world's demise.
[Chorus:]
Asgård's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow the throne
Deceiver!
Deceiver of the gods!
All this rage, and all this hate,
It burns me deep inside,
And still it is, the only thing, keeping me alive.
Dark ambition within my heart and it's aching to break free
The one true nature of my soul, the giant lives in me.
Kneel!
You all shall kneel to me!
Or death will set you free!
You all shall kneel to me!
Fall!
You all shall fall to me!
Vengeance will be sweet!
You all shall fall to me!
[Chorus:]
Asgård's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow the throne
Deceiver of the gods!
[Chorus:]
Asgård's always been my home
I'm born from different blood
I've come to overthrow the throne
Deceiver!
Deceiver of the gods!
Deceiver of the gods!
Yeah!
Heimdall gazes east
A sail has caught his eye
He lifts his hand and sounds the horn
The undead army has arrived
Here comes Nagelfar
With Laufey's son on board
He brings chaos, hate and wrath
He brings the war to end all wars
Heimdall knows his fate
The end of all nine worlds
It's what the Vala has foreseen
He knows that everything shall burn
Facing Lopt's deceit
Now they finally meet
The champion and his enemy
On Vigrid's plains they'll find defeat
Their swords meet in a mighty clash
War cries sound, horns they blast
Their eager weapons whip and thrash
This day when all shall end
The lords of war are equal strong
This battle frantic and forlorn
The blades sing a macabre song
This day when all shall end
Heimdall's blade bites burning sharp
As it cuts through flesh and bone
Blood comes gushing from the wound
As Loke's head falls tumbling
Rolling to the burning ground
So he found the heart in barren land
It was beating, still alive
He held it gently in his hand
And looked up to the sky
With evil thoughts of vicious kind
And sinister disdain
His thoughts of bringing back to life
The witch that died in flames
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!
He then devoured Gullveig's heart
And she was born again
They brought to life an evil force
A beast that can't be tamed
With dark deception in his soul
Betrayal of the gods
The bane of Oden now is born
Born of evil blood
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!
They brought to life a malicious force
A vile beast that cannot be tamed
Fimbultýr's nemesis now is born
A vile beast that can't be restrained
Dark!
Deception in his
Soul!
Betrayal of the
Gods!
Oden's bane is
Born!
Born of evil blood!
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf
Born of sin
I was born of giant's blood
Raised in Asgård, the home of gods
I am the master of disguise
For this trait I've gained your prise
Fast in thought, quicker tongue
Brawl with me and you'll get stung
I am the master of deceit
My words bind or set you free
[Chorus:]
I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter
You call me evil; curse my name
But you only have yourselves to blame
Order needs its anarchy
Balance through calamity
We mixed our blood in olden days
Now I wander like a stray
We were brothers, now estranged
I will have my sweet revenge
My words are poison to your ears
I say the words you fear
Still you know it is the truth you hear
Ragnarök is drawing near
There you sit in Aegir's hall
Waiting for the coming fall
Council of the now condemned
Twilight of both gods and men
Face the facts; you're old and weak
Empty words are all you speak
No escape, there's no return
The universe shall bleed and burn
[Chorus:]
I am the eagle in the sky
The shape shifter
Vicious wolf
Howling in the night
The shape shifter
I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter
I am the eagle in the sky
The vicious wolf
Howling in the night
I am the walker on the wind
Lying words,
With an honest grin
The shape shifter
Outside these walls
An army awaits
But in these halls
We feel safe
Countless attacks
We have repelled
They won't turn back
They cannot be quelled
[Chorus:]
Supplies are running low
Starvation now awaits
Reinforcements will not show
The day is much too late
Broken and weak
Never give in
Prospects are bleak
We can't win
There is no hope
No time for lament
End of the rope
Our lives are spent
We have held out for months
Hoping for relief
Our fortress now our tomb
And salvation now our grief
We have held out for months
Waiting for relief
Our fortune's now our own
This is destiny
[Chorus:]
Supplies are running low
Starvation now awaits
Reinforcements never showed
As the daylight starts to fade
There's nothing left to lose
We have run out of time
There is nothing left to choose
Except how we shall die
Open the gates!
Now we attack!
Ride into fate!
No turning back!
Stand by the King!
To glory we ride!
Weapons and shield!
Together we die!
All is lost now!
Show no fear now!
All the world shall know our bravery!
All is lost now!
Show no fear now!
One last charge for death or victory!
Yeah!
Look to my burning eyes
Plead for your worthless life
All remorse I had has died
And all I have is hate inside
You took my soul from me
You took my family
You killed them all ferociously
Now this is what I give to thee
[Chorus:]
Carved upon your naked back
Blood eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs are cracked
Blood eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes they stare
Terror grips your dying heart
Blood eagle!
Helpless on the ground
Hands and feet tightly bound
In my eyes no mercy found
My sharp knife starts to carve around
Penetrate your naked skin
Rip flesh and dig within
With a pleased and twisted grin
I spread your lungs like eagle's wings
The burning grief is tormenting me
The hate I feel is destroying me
Only vengeance will give me peace
Only vengeance will set my spirit free
[Chorus:]
Carved upon your naked back
Blood eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs will crack
Blood eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes will stare
Slow death grips your tortured heart
Blood eagle!
Blood eagle!
Blood eagle!
Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battle field
Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny
March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!
Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear
Hold the lines! Move as one!
In unity our victory's won
Our shields will form a mighty wall
United we shall never fall
Fear will not pierce our hearts
Though swords and arrows will
Victory is our reward
For all the blood we spill
We didn't come to waste our lives
Like pawns in a savage game
Our spirits, spears
And shields are linked
In a much stronger chain
March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!
All are one
And one is all
Side by side
The battle calls
All are one
And one is all
Shield by shield
We'll never fall
Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear
Charge with force! Break their ranks!
No remorse, crush their flanks!
Pulverize their human wall!
We shall destroy!
Welcome to my humble home
Your soul is mine to keep
There are no walls of rock and stone
Yet no one ever leaves
Those who die of age and plague
Are welcomed in my court
Murderers, miscreants
Will linger here and rot
Those who die inglorious
And those who die in shame
They are all sent to my dark halls
They all shall fear my name
[Chorus:]
Here hunger is your plate
Here famine is your knife
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to Hel
I welcome you to Hel
Now here you are in my cold realm
You are my honoured guest
At the banquette of the dead
Your soul will never rest
Your soul is mine to keep.
Your soul is mine to keep.
And you will never leave.
And you will never leave.
[Chorus:]
Here sickness is your bed
Here ruin is your fell
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to
Here hunger is your plate
Here famine is your knife
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to Hel
Racing 'cross the arctic lands
A mounted legion
Under my command
We're a brutal force
No men can withstand
Total havoc is at hand
[Chorus:]
See the black crows circle high
Waiting for brave men to die
They sense the coming of the tide
When opposition's swept aside
The fateful message
Reached us months ago
That our home was under siege
And since that day
We've been heading north
Our kinsmen needed our relief
As we near our fortress walls
Black smoke is rising to the sky
Burnt black ruins
Of our father's halls
And corpses greet our tired eyes
What madness led them to attack
Victory could not be won
They must've known
There was no turning back
And now they all are gone
No woman, child or man was spared
Their bodies lying where they fell
Suffering, anguish and despair
As they went through living hell
So now we're on the ride again
And vengeance is
Our newfound path
We draw our strength
From grief and pain
These bastards shall know
Our endless wrath
[Chorus:]
See the black crows circle high
Waiting for brave men to die
This is the coming of the tide
When opposition's swept aside
We were the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We'd never lost a fight in war
We feared not the grave
The ruler of this northern court
My brother, lord, king
He always had our loyal swords
But we would feel his sting
The aging king had no descendants
No heir to take his throne
It filled his soul with fear
Transcendent
That next in line was my first-born
The king's heart grew
Full of dark deception
Full of foul conspiracy
This was when dark days
Had their inception
And we fell to his vile deceit
Robbed of arms, robbed of pride
But he spared our lives
The fear he had of Oden's wrath
Held his vengeful knife
With hearts so cold we left our homes
Banished from our land
A life in shame, a life in grief
Until we rise again
Winters come, winters pass
Twenty wasted years
We're aging men, our youth is gone
We will shed no tears
Winters come and winters pass
Twenty years have gone
Like a dream we fade away
Into oblivion
We are the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We're old but strong as before
And we don't fear the grave
From the south an army rises
They ride under cross of gold
From the shades we're called
In a time of crisis
To defend the king now weak and old
As the flames of warfare rage higher
We feel our destiny's embrace
We are aging men of an old empire
Now we can see Valhalla's gates
We!
March again
First in line
To reach Valhalla's mighty gates
We!
March again
March to fight
To reach Valhalla's mighty
We!
March again
Give our lives
To reach Valhalla's
Mighty royal gates
